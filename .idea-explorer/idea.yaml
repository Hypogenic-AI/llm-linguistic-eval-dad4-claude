  title: Evaluating Linguistic Performance in LLMs
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Large language models trained predominantly on English data may exhibit
    reduced performance when deployed in non-English-speaking countries. Evaluating
    LLMs across multiple languages may reveal implicit internal translation mechanisms
    and highlight the need for multilingual benchmarks.

    '
  background:
    description: 'Large language models are trained predominantly on English data,
      yet they are increasingly deployed at national scale in non-English-speaking
      countries. (ie XAI partnership with Venzeula, Open-AI with Estonia)

      Despite this, model capability evaluations and training data are overwhelmingly
      English-centric.

      It may be interesting to host some evaluation benchmark/ leaderboard for LLM
      performance across languages. Is it possible that these models have some implicit
      internal translation mechanisms?'
