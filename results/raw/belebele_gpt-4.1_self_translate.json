      "Passage: Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences. Members of virtual teams often serve as the contact points for their corresponding offline teams. They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may schedule meetings across different time zones, which local management may not understand. The existence of truly \"invisible teams\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams. An \"invisible team\" refers to the management team to which each member reports. It sets standards for all members.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, what similarity exists between traditional teams and virtual teams?\n\nOptions:\n1. Both types of teams are expected to have the same level of work performance.\n2. Both types of teams have varying degrees of autonomy in their daily work.\n3. Both types of teams report to an invisible management team.\n4. Both types of teams operate in the same time zone.\n\n1",
      "Passage: This traditional medieval castle has long inspired people's imagination, evoking images of jousting on horseback, banquets, and the chivalry of King Arthur's knights. Even when standing among the thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy for people to recall the sounds and smells of wars long past; one can almost hear the clatter of hooves on cobblestones and smell the scent of fear wafting from the dungeon pits. But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles originally built? How were they designed and constructed?\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage as something possibly related to medieval castles?\n\nOptions:\n1. Dungeon pits\n2. Jousting on horseback\n3. Chivalry\n4. Knights\n\n4",
      "Passage: Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is just a general term that encompasses a wide variety of local cuisines from across the country. However, without further qualifiers, the term often refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island, Java. Now, Javanese cuisine can be found throughout the archipelago, and it features many dishes with simple seasoning methods. The main seasonings favored by the Javanese include peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is mainly used in Javanese cuisine?\n\nOptions:\n1. White sugar\n2. Powdered sugar\n3. Coconut sugar\n4. Brown sugar\n\n3",
      "Passage: \"Because passengers were waiting in 90°F heat, they were able to receive distributed water. Fire Chief Scott Koons said: 'It was very hot in Santa Clara that day, the temperature was over 90 degrees Fahrenheit.' Every minute and second trapped on the roller coaster was uncomfortable, and it is no exaggeration to say that it took us at least an hour to get the first person off the roller coaster.'\"\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, who commented on the uncomfortable high temperature?\n\nOptions:\n1. Roller coaster operator\n2. Fire Chief\n3. Passengers\n4. Police Chief\n\n2",
      "Passage: Stars emit light and heat because energy is produced when hydrogen atoms combine (or fuse) together to form heavier elements. Scientists are currently working to build a reactor that can generate energy in the same way. However, this is a very difficult problem to solve. It will take many years before we can see a practical fusion reactor built.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, what does fusion enable stars to do?\n\nOptions:\n1. Form heavier elements\n2. Build fusion reactors\n3. Emit light and heat\n4. Produce hydrogen atoms\n\n3",

However, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later studied history, obtaining a 2:2 degree (second class honours, lower division). Charles was the first British royal family member to obtain a degree.\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided in the passage, what was Charles the first British royal family member to do?\n\nOptions:\n1. Join the military before completing his studies\n2. Study archaeology\n3. Obtain a degree\n4. Attend Trinity College\n\n3",
      "Passage: Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further. Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a means of assisting people who are just learning to use a new computer program or starting a new project. Scaffolding can be conducted online or offline; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, just like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office. Virtual support is built into the software to question, prompt, and explain things that might be difficult for students to handle on their own.\n\nQuestion: According to the information in this passage, which of the following is NOT an example of scaffolding?\n\nOptions:\n1. A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game\n2. An SAT tutor\n3. An independent study plan\n4. A coach of a small league\n\n3",
      "Passage:  \nHospitality exchange networks are organizations that connect travelers with local residents in their destination cities. To join such an organization, one usually only needs to fill out an online form; although some organizations offer or require additional verification. Afterwards, a paper and/or online list is provided, listing hosts who still have available rooms, sometimes with recommendations and reviews from other travelers. Couchsurfing was established in January 2004. Before that, computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but had no place to stay. After he emailed students at a local university, he was flooded with offers of free accommodation.\n\nQuestion:  \nWhat does a hospitality exchange network provide to travelers?\n\nOptions:  \n1. Accommodation with local hosts  \n2. Cheap flights  \n3. Tours provided by local guides  \n4. Connections with other travelers going to the same destination  \n\n1",
      "Passage: Perhaps the most common type of tourism, and also the one most people think of when they think of travel: leisure tourism. This refers to people going to a place very different from their daily lives for relaxation and entertainment. Beaches, theme parks, and campsites are often the most frequented places for leisure tourists. If a person's purpose in visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture, then this type of tourism activity is called cultural tourism. Tourists may visit different landmarks in a specific country, or they may focus on touring just one region.\n\nQuestion: Visiting museums belongs to which of the following types of tourism?\n\nOptions:\n1. Business tourism\n2. Leisure tourism\n3. Cultural tourism\n4. Outdoor tourism\n\n3",
      "Passage: The shock of returning home comes faster than culture shock (the honeymoon period is shorter), lasts longer, and can also be more severe. For travelers who easily adapt to a new culture, it is sometimes difficult to readapt to their native culture. After living abroad for a period of time and returning home, you may find that you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits of your home culture. When you first go abroad, people may be very patient and understanding with you because they know that travelers need to adapt when coming to a new country. People may not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding on their return journey.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which type of traveler may have more difficulty adapting to the shock of returning home?\n\nOptions:\n1. Travelers who have experienced particularly bad culture shock\n2. Travelers who can quickly adapt while living abroad\n3. Travelers who are still in the honeymoon period\n4. Travelers who lack patience\n\n2",
      "Passage: Throwing a boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn. If you want to learn to throw a boomerang so that it returns to your hand after being thrown, be sure to use a suitable boomerang that can actually return. In fact, most boomerangs on the market in Australia do not return. Beginners are advised not to try throwing boomerangs in strong winds.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which of the following statements accurately describes boomerang throwing?\n\nOptions:\n1. If thrown correctly, it will always return to your hand.\n2. It is more popular among locals than among tourists.\n3. There are not many boomerangs available in Australia.\n4.

All Blacks and Australia\n2. New Zealand and South Africa\n3. South Africa and Australia\n4. Springboks and All Blacks\n\n3",
      "Passage:  \nThe \"up-bow\" symbol looks like the letter V, while the \"down-bow\" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side. \"Up-bow\" means to push the bow from the tip, while \"down-bow\" means to pull the bow from the frog (that is, the part of the bow held by the hand). Up-bow usually produces a softer sound, while down-bow produces a stronger, more determined sound. Feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that printed musical notes have musical significance, so they should generally be respected.\n\nQuestion:  \nAccording to this passage, which of the following is unrelated to bowing?\n\nOptions:  \n1. Softer sound  \n2. A symbol that looks like a staple  \n3. Stronger sound  \n4. Starting from the frog\n\nAnswer:  \n2",
      "Passage: Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of 9 members. This is the fifth time in four years that Martelly has joined Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP). Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended that the previous CEP resign as part of measures to move the country toward new elections. The commission was Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October. Since 2011, these protests have been triggered by the failure to hold some elections as scheduled, and sometimes the protests have escalated into violence.\n\nQuestion: Who recommended that the last CEP resign?\n\nOptions:\n1. Martelly\n2. Protesters\n3. The Presidential Commission\n4. The CEP members themselves recommended resignation\n\n3",
      "Passage: The first cases of the season were reported in late July. Pigs carry the disease, which is then transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. This outbreak prompted the Indian government to take several measures, such as placing pig traps in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying insecticides. The government also promised to provide millions of encephalitis vaccines, which will help medical institutions prepare for next year. Due to a lack of funds and lower priority compared to other diseases, the plan to provide vaccines to historically hardest-hit areas was postponed this year.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which epidemic prevention measure will be implemented last?\n\nOptions:\n1. Insecticides\n2. Pig traps\n3. Encephalitis vaccines\n4. Mosquito nets\n\n3",
      "Passage: Relying solely on proper nutritional practices is not enough to achieve outstanding performance, but it can significantly impact the overall health of young athletes.

      "Passage: When the race changes from a quarter mile to a half mile, speed becomes less important, and endurance becomes the absolutely crucial factor. Of course, to become a top half-mile runner (finishing within two minutes), one must have sufficient speed and develop endurance at all costs. Practicing cross-country running in the winter, along with upper body fitness training, can fully prepare one for the running season.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which of the following is most important for a top half-mile runner?\n\nOptions:\n1. Practicing cross-country running in the winter\n2. Developing endurance rather than speed\n3. Finishing within two minutes\n4. Developing speed rather than endurance\n\nAnswer:\n2",
      "Passage: On the tropical savanna, primates have a digestive system similar to that of humans, and the existing plant resources can hardly meet the amino acid needs of primates. Furthermore, failing to do so will have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death. The most easily available plant resources should be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but primates like us find it difficult to digest such proteins unless they are cooked. In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids. In summary, if our ancestors solved the \"protein problem\" in the same way as chimpanzees on the tropical savanna do today, we should not be surprised.\n\nQuestion: According to the information in the passage, which type of food should primates eat to solve the \"protein problem\"?\n\nOptions:\n1. Withered leaves\n2. Raw legumes\n3. Grasshoppers\n4. Flower stems\n\n3",
      "Passage: When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites. After receiving the call in space, the satellite almost immediately reflects it back. Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light and views. To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following reflects long-distance phone calls back to Earth?\n\nOptions:\n1. Telescope\n2. Satellite\n3. Light\n4. Rocket\n\n2",
      "Passage: What kind of force does the gravity of Io (Jupiter's moon) exert on me? If you stand on the surface of Io, your weight would be lighter than on Earth. A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kilograms) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kilograms) on Io. Therefore, gravity naturally exerts a smaller pulling force on you.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which of the following is an accurate statement about the gravity of Io?\n\nOptions:\n1. Earth exerts a smaller pulling force on you than Io does.\n2. Io's pulling force is greater, which is why you are lighter.\n3. Io's pulling force is greater, which is why you are heavier.\n4.

      "Passage: The photographer was sent to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, but did not survive. Reports say he was only in his 20s. Bieber issued a statement saying: \"Although I was not present at the time and did not directly experience this tragic accident, I still feel sad for the family of the deceased and pray for them.\" Entertainment news website TMZ learned that the photographer parked on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard, began photographing the police stop, and after crossing the street continued to take pictures, prompting the California Highway Patrol officers conducting the traffic stop to stop their work twice and order him to return to the other side. According to the police, the driver of the car that hit the photographer may not face criminal charges.\n\nQuestion: What was the photographer trying to do before being hit by the car?\n\nOptions:\n1. Park on Sepulveda Boulevard\n2. Photograph the police stop\n3. Cross the busy road\n4. Persuade the police to let him continue photographing\n\n2",

Detonate bombs at landmarks in one country\n2. Detonate bombs in two countries\n3. Detonate bombs at landmarks in two countries\n4. Detonate bombs in one country\n\n3",
      "Passage: As a typical building of that period, Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a real castle. Its large glass windows and thin walls could not possibly withstand a determined attack for long. In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began building the castle, the country was still relatively peaceful and only needed to defend against small groups of roaming marauders.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is an accurate description of Muxloe Castle?\n\nOptions:\n1. The castle's thick walls were built at the request of Lord Hastings.\n2. Due to the peaceful nature of the country at the time, it required minimal fortifications.\n3. The construction of the castle did not conform to the typical style of the time.\n4. It was built to withstand a prolonged and determined attack.\n\n2",
      "Passage: Komen Foundation spokesperson Leslie Aun stated that the organization has adopted a new rule that does not allow funding or grants to organizations that are under legal investigation. Komen's policy has stalled Planned Parenthood because it is awaiting the results of an investigation into Planned Parenthood's funding and reporting, conducted by Congressman Cliff Stearns. As chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee under the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Stearns is currently investigating whether tax money is being used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood.\n\nQuestion: Which organization is under legal investigation?\n\nOptions:\n1. House Energy and Commerce Committee\n2. Komen Foundation\n3. Planned Parenthood\n4. Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee\n\n3",
      "Passage: The teeth of the Triceratops could not only crush leaves, but also very hard branches and roots. Some scientists believe that Triceratops fed on cycads, a type of plant that was very common during the Cretaceous period. These plants looked like small palm trees, with crowns made up of nail-like sharp leaves. Before eating the trunk, the Triceratops would use its powerful beak to strip off the leaves. Other scientists believe these plants were poisonous, so dinosaurs were unlikely to eat them, even though nowadays sloths and other animals such as parrots (descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which part of the cycad plant might Triceratops eat?\n\nOptions:\n1. Nail-like leaves\n2. Trunk\n3. Roots\n4. Fruit\n\n2",
      "Passage:  \nGoma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the easternmost part of Congo, near Rwanda. In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The volcanic lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center. Although Goma is relatively safe, you should investigate in advance before going anywhere outside Goma to find out whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province has eased. The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and for Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project. You can tour Goma by taking a boda-boda (rented motorcycle). The normal (local) price for a short ride is 500 Congolese francs.\n\nQuestion:  \nWhich of the following is NOT good advice for tourists in Goma?\n\nOptions:  \n1. The fighting in North Kivu is interesting  \n2. It is a good place for cheap mountain gorilla tracking  \n3. Rented motorcycles are a good means of transportation  \n4.

      "Passage: Whether out of necessity, to change your lifestyle, or to challenge yourself, if you want to see the world for the least amount of money, there are some ways to help you do it. Basically, they can be divided into two categories: either work while traveling, or minimize expenses as much as possible. This article focuses on the latter. For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort and time, enjoy surprising journeys, and want to reduce expenses to nearly zero, please refer to the \"Minimum Budget Travel Guide.\" This scenario assumes that travelers will not steal, trespass, participate in illegal markets, beg, or exploit others for personal gain.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, who might find it more difficult to travel on an extremely limited budget?\n\nOptions:\n1. People who like to accept challenges\n2. People without strict time constraints\n3. People planning to work remotely during their travels\n4. People who like to follow an itinerary\n\n4",
      "Passage: The variety of French used in Belgium and Switzerland, although very similar to the French used in France and mutually intelligible, is still slightly different. Specifically, the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has some subtle particularities in the number system, which are different from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is also slightly different. However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn standard French in school, so even if you use the standard French metric system, they can understand you.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is different in France compared to Belgium or Switzerland?\n\nOptions:\n1.

They are both subject to the same performance expectations\n2. They both have a variable level of autonomy in their daily routine\n3. They both report to an invisible management team\n4. They both operate in the same time zone\n\n1",

      "Passage: \"In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system like that of humans to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant resources. Moreover, failure to do so leads to such serious consequences as stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death. The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates like us unless they are cooked. In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also represents a rich source of proteins containing all essential amino acids. Taking all of the above into account, it is not surprising that our ancestors solved the 'protein problem' in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savanna do to this day.\"\n\nQuestion: Taking into account the information presented in the text, what should a primate eat to solve the \"protein problem\"?\n\nOptions:\n1.

Each episode of the show is dedicated to a theme in a particular book and then explores that theme through various stories. Each show also gives a recommendation about a book that children should look for when they go to the library. John Grant from WNED Buffalo (where Reading Rainbow is broadcast) said: 'The show Reading Rainbow showed children why they need to read, ... instilled a love of reading — [it] encouraged children to pick up a book and read it.' Some, including John Grant, believe that the end of the series was caused by both a lack of funding and a change in the concept of educational TV programs.\"\n\nQuestion: What led to the cancellation of the series Reading Rainbow?\n\nOptions:\n1.

The landing site was inaccessible\n2. There were several other planes before CG4684\n3. The plane was diverted to Kokoda\n4. The weather conditions were bad\n\n4",
      "Passage: Avalanches are not an anomaly; steep slopes can hold only a limited amount of snow, and its excess amounts descend in the form of avalanches. The problem is that snow is sticky, so for it to slide down, some kind of impact is necessary, and a small amount of sliding snow can become this very impact for the rest of the mass.

      "Passage:  \nVirtual teams are required to achieve the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences. Members of virtual teams often serve as points of contact for their immediate physical groups. Virtual teams may hold meetings according to time zones, but since such things are difficult for local management to understand, members often have higher autonomy than traditional team members. The existence of a true \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of virtual teams. The \"invisible team\" refers to the management who are the superiors of each member.

This is when people go to places completely different from their daily lives and enjoy themselves in a relaxed mood. Beaches, theme parks, and campgrounds are the most common places visited by recreational tourists. If the purpose of visiting a particular place is to learn about its history or culture, that type of tourism is called cultural tourism.

Due to this large outbreak, the Indian government took measures such as deploying pig catchers to severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying insecticides. Millions of encephalitis vaccines have also been promised by the government, which will help health agencies prepare for the coming year.

      "Passage: For primates with a digestive system like that of humans, it is difficult to obtain essential amino acids from plant resources available in the savanna environment. Moreover, neglecting this leads to serious consequences such as growth suppression and malnutrition, and ultimately results in death. The most easily accessible plant resources were proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are nutrients that are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked. On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also are high-quality protein sources that contain all essential amino acids.

      "**Passage (Translation):**  \nWhile foundational education of a project should make learning easier and more enjoyable, guidance goes a step further. Training methods are not a way of studying but a service that provides support to people who are experiencing a new learning situation such as using a new computer program or starting a new project. Platforms can be both physical and virtual; in other words, a teacher is a type of platform but so is that little paperclip character in Microsoft Office. Virtual platforms are embedded within programs for the purpose of questioning, persuading, and explaining procedures that might have been a major challenge for the student to handle alone.\n\n**Question (Translation):**  \nAccording to the information in this passage, which of the following is NOT an example of supportive training?\n\n**Options (Translation):**  \n1.

      "Passage: Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences between them. Members of a virtual team often act as points of contact for their immediate physical group. They have more freedom compared to traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management. The presence of a true \"invisible team\" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team. The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.\n\nQuestion: According to the passage, how are regular teams and virtual teams similar?\n\nOptions:\n1. Both teams are expected to perform at the same level\n2. Both teams work independently to varying degrees in day-to-day activities\n3. Both teams report to an invisible management team\n4. Both teams work in the same time zone\n\n1",
      "Passage: The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, bringing to mind images of jousts, feasts, and Arthurian chivalry. Even while standing among thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-past battles, almost like hearing the clatter of hooves on coals and smelling the fear rising from the dungeons' pits. But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built at all? How were they designed and constructed?\n\nQuestion: Which of the following things are NOT mentioned in the passage that could be associated with medieval fortifications?\n\nOptions:\n1. Dungeon pits\n2. Jousts\n3. Chivalry\n4. Heroes\n\n4",
