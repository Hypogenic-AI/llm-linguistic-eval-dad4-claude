      "Step 1: The passage says Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the indoor ice events.\nStep 2: It also says that skiing events will be at the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km from Beijing.\nStep 3: The question asks which event will NOT be held in Beijing.\nStep 4: Option 1 (Opening ceremonies), Option 3 (Closing ceremonies), and Option 4 (Indoor ice events) are all specifically mentioned as being held in Beijing.\nStep 5: Option 2 (Taizicheng ski area events) are said to be held in Zhangjiakou, not Beijing.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The question asks how conventional teams and virtual teams are alike, according to the passage.\n2. Let's examine each option in light of the passage:\n\n   - Option 1: \"Both teams are expected to perform at the same level.\" The passage says, \"Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams,\" which means both are expected to perform at the same level.\n   - Option 2: \"Both teams have varying levels of autonomy in their day-to-day routines.\" The passage specifically says virtual team members often have more autonomy than conventional team members, implying a difference, not a similarity.\n   - Option 3: \"Both teams report to an invisible management team.\" The passage says the \"invisible team\" is unique to virtual teams, not conventional teams.\n   - Option 4: \"Both teams function in the same time zone.\" The passage says virtual teams may meet according to varying time zones, which may not be understood by their local management, implying a difference.\n\n3. Only option 1 is supported by the passage as a similarity.\n\nFinal answer:\n1",
      "Step 1: Let's identify what the passage says people associate with medieval castles.  \nThe passage mentions:  \n- \"jousts\"  \n- \"banquets\"  \n- \"Arthurian chivalry\"  \n- \"the sounds and smells of battles long gone\"  \n- \"the clatter of hooves on the cobbles\"  \n- \"the fear rising from the dungeon pits\"\n\nStep 2: Now, let's look at the options:  \n1. Dungeon pits – Mentioned directly: \"the fear rising from the dungeon pits\"  \n2. Jousts – Mentioned directly: \"images of jousts\"  \n3. Chivalry – Mentioned directly: \"Arthurian chivalry\"  \n4. Knights – The word \"knights\" is not mentioned anywhere in the passage.\n\nStep 3: The question asks for what is NOT mentioned as something one might associate with medieval castles.\n\nFinal answer:  \n4",
      "Step 1: The passage discusses Indonesian food and specifically mentions Javanese cuisine.\nStep 2: It states that Javanese cuisine features simply seasoned dishes.\nStep 3: The passage lists the predominant flavorings in Javanese cuisine: peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.\nStep 4: The key phrase is \"especially Javanese coconut sugar,\" indicating that coconut sugar is the main type of sugar used.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step 1: The question asks who made a comment about the uncomfortable heat level.\nStep 2: The passage includes a direct quote: Fire captain Scott Kouns said, \"It was a hot day in the Santa Clara with temperatures in the 90s. Any length of time trapped on a roller coaster would be uncomfortable, to say the least, and it took at least an hour to get the first person off the ride.\"\nStep 3: This quote is attributed to the fire captain, Scott Kouns.\nStep 4: None of the other options (ride operator, passengers, police chief) are mentioned as making this comment.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n- The passage says that stars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms are fused together to form heavier elements.\n- This means fusion allows stars to both form heavier elements and give off light and heat.\n- The question asks what fusion allows stars to do, so we need to pick the most direct effect.\n- Option 1 says \"Form heavier elements,\" which is mentioned in the passage.\n- Option 2 says \"Build fusion reactors,\" but the passage says scientists are trying to do this, not stars.\n- Option 3 says \"Give off light and heat,\" which is also mentioned as a result of fusion in stars.\n- Option 4 says \"Create hydrogen atoms,\" but the passage says hydrogen atoms are fused, not created.\n\nBetween options 1 and 3, the passage directly links fusion to both forming heavier elements and giving off light and heat. However, the question is about what fusion allows stars to do, and the passage emphasizes that the energy from fusion is what allows stars to give off light and heat.\n\nThe best answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step 1: The passage says that traditionally, the heir to the throne would go straight into the military after finishing school. This means it was common for heirs to join the military, not unique to Charles.\n\nStep 2: The passage states that Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History. However, it does not say he was the first to study Archaeology specifically.\n\nStep 3: The passage says Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree. This is a unique achievement mentioned in the passage.\n\nStep 4: The passage mentions that Charles attended Trinity College, but it does not say he was the first royal to do so.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage defines scaffolding as support provided to individuals undergoing a new learning experience. Scaffolds can be real (like a teacher) or virtual (like the paperclip man in Microsoft Office). The purpose of scaffolding is to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner to handle alone.\n\n2. Let's analyze each option:\n   - Option 1: A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game is a virtual scaffold. It provides support and guidance to help the player learn the game.\n   - Option 2: An SAT tutor is a real scaffold. The tutor supports and guides the student through the learning process.\n   - Option 3: An independent study program is not a scaffold. It implies the student is learning on their own, without support or guidance.\n   - Option 4: A little league coach is a real scaffold. The coach supports and guides the players as they learn the sport.\n\n3. The passage makes it clear that scaffolding involves support, and the only option that does not provide support is the independent study program.\n\nFinal answer:\n3",
      "Step 1: The passage defines a hospitality exchange network as an organization that connects travelers with locals in the cities they are going to visit.\n\nStep 2: It explains that joining such a network usually involves filling out an online form, and that a listing of available hosts is provided.\n\nStep 3: The passage gives an example of Couchsurfing, where Casey Fenton received offers for free accommodation from locals.\n\nStep 4: The key idea is that travelers are connected with local hosts who offer them a place to stay.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's look at the options:\n- Option 1: Accommodations with local hosts – This matches the passage.\n- Option 2: Cheap flights – The passage mentions a cheap flight, but that is not what the network offers.\n- Option 3: Tours given by local guides – The passage does not mention this.\n- Option 4: Connections with other travelers visiting the same destination – The passage does not mention this.\n\nFinal answer:\n1",
      "Step 1: The passage describes two types of tourism: recreational tourism and cultural tourism.\nStep 2: Recreational tourism is about relaxing and having fun, often at beaches, theme parks, or campgrounds.\nStep 3: Cultural tourism is when the objective is to get to know the history and culture of a place, such as visiting landmarks.\nStep 4: A museum is a place where people learn about history and culture.\nStep 5: Therefore, visiting a museum fits the description of cultural tourism.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses re-entry shock, which happens when someone returns home after living abroad.\n2. It says re-entry shock comes on sooner, lasts longer, and can be more severe than culture shock.\n3. The passage specifically mentions: \"Travellers who had an easy time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly hard time readjusting to their native culture.\"\n4. This means that people who adjusted quickly and easily to the new culture (while abroad) might find it especially difficult to readjust when they return home.\n5. Option 2 matches this description: \"Travelers who adjusted quickly while living abroad.\"\n6. The other options do not match what the passage says.\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Step 1: The passage mentions that boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire, but does not compare its popularity between locals and tourists. So, option 2 is not supported.\n\nStep 2: The passage says, \"Most boomerangs available in Australia are in fact non-returning,\" which means there are many boomerangs, but not all are returning. So, option 3 is incorrect.\n\nStep 3: The passage advises to make sure you have a suitable boomerang for returning, implying that only some boomerangs are able to return. This matches option 4.\n\nStep 4: The passage does not say that a boomerang will always come back if thrown correctly, only that you need a suitable (returning) boomerang. So, option 1 is not accurate.\n\nFinal answer:\n4",
      "Step 1: The passage mentions that the match at Ellis Park in Johannesburg is the final match of the series.\nStep 2: It states that the Springboks (South Africa) will play Australia in that match.\nStep 3: The All Blacks (New Zealand) have already played their final match and will not be playing at Ellis Park.\nStep 4: Therefore, the teams playing at Ellis Park are South Africa (Springboks) and Australia.\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n3",
      "Let's break down the passage:\n\n- The \"up bow\" mark looks like a V. Up means you start at the tip and push the bow. An up-bow usually generates a softer sound.\n- The \"down bow\" mark looks like a staple. Down means you start at the frog and pull the bow. A down-bow is stronger and more assertive.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. A softer sound — The passage says a softer sound is associated with up-bow, which is pushing, not pulling.\n2. A mark that looks like a staple — The staple mark is for down-bow, which is pulling.\n3. A stronger sound — The passage says pulling (down-bow) is stronger.\n4. Starting at the frog — Pulling (down-bow) starts at the frog.\n\nSo, the only option NOT associated with pulling the bow is \"a softer sound.\"\n\n1",
      "Step 1: The passage mentions that Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) after the prior one resigned.\nStep 2: It states that last month a presidential commission recommended the prior CEP's resignation.\nStep 3: The commission was created by Martelly in response to protests.\nStep 4: The passage does not say that Martelly himself, the protesters, or the CEP members suggested the resignation directly.\nStep 5: Therefore, the correct answer is the presidential commission.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes several measures taken by the Indian government in response to the disease outbreak: deployment of pig catchers, distribution of mosquito curtains, spraying pesticides, and promising several million vials of encephalitis vaccine.\n2. The passage states that pig catchers, mosquito curtains, and pesticides are being used in \"seriously affected areas\" as immediate measures.\n3. Regarding the encephalitis vaccine, the passage says: \"Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine have also been promised by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for next year.\" It also mentions that \"plans for vaccines to be delivered to the historically most affected areas this year were delayed due to lack of funds and low prioritisation relative to other diseases.\"\n4. This means that the vaccine will not be delivered immediately, but rather in preparation for next year, and that delivery this year was delayed.\n5. Therefore, among the listed measures, the encephalitis vaccine will be implemented last.\n\nAnswer:\n3",
      "Step 1: The passage discusses the importance of proper nutritional practices for young athletes, stating that while nutrition alone cannot create elite performances, it can improve overall wellness and enjoyment of the sport.\n\nStep 2: The passage specifically mentions maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding supplementation as ways to help athletes improve performance and enjoyment.\n\nStep 3: Let's examine each option:\n- Option 1: Practicing proper nutrition is mentioned as beneficial.\n- Option 2: Consistently performing at an elite level is not mentioned as a way to increase enjoyment; in fact, the passage says nutrition alone cannot generate elite performances.\n- Option 3: Hydrating effectively is mentioned as beneficial.\n- Option 4: Maintaining a healthy energy balance is mentioned as beneficial.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the only option not suggested by the passage as a way to find more enjoyment is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the difference between the quarter mile and half mile run, stating that \"speed becomes of much less importance and endurance becomes an absolute necessity\" for the half mile.\n2. It acknowledges that a first-class half-miler \"must be possessed of a fair amount of speed,\" but emphasizes that \"endurance must be cultivated at all hazards.\"\n3. The passage suggests cross country running and gymnasium work as preparation, but these are means to an end, not the \"utmost importance.\"\n4. Option 1 refers to a recommended practice, not the most important quality.\n5. Option 2 directly reflects the passage's main point: \"endurance must be cultivated at all hazards,\" meaning it is of utmost importance.\n6. Option 3 is a benchmark for a first-class runner, but the passage focuses on the quality needed, not just the time.\n7. Option 4 is the opposite of what the passage says.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage says that primates with a digestive system like humans have trouble getting enough amino acids from available plant resources on the savanna.\n2. It mentions that failure to get enough protein leads to serious health problems.\n3. The most accessible plant proteins are in leaves and legumes, but these are hard to digest unless cooked.\n4. In contrast, animal foods like ants, termites, and eggs are easily digestible and provide all essential amino acids.\n5. The passage suggests that our ancestors likely solved their protein problem by eating animal foods, similar to how chimps do today.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Dead leaves – These are plant resources and, according to the passage, hard to digest and not a good source of protein unless cooked.\n2. Raw legumes – Also plant resources, and the passage says they are hard to digest unless cooked.\n3. Grasshoppers – These are animal foods, similar to ants and termites mentioned in the passage, and would provide easily digestible, complete proteins.\n4. Flower stems – Another plant resource, which the passage suggests is not a good solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step 1: The question asks what reflects long distance calls back down to Earth.\n\nStep 2: According to the passage, \"When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite. The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.\"\n\nStep 3: This means satellites are responsible for reflecting long distance calls back down to Earth.\n\nStep 4: Let's check the options:\n1. Telescopes – The passage says telescopes are used by scientists to see better in space, not for calls.\n2. Satellites – The passage says satellites reflect calls back down.\n3. Lights – The passage mentions light, but not in the context of calls.\n4. Rockets – Rockets are used to send satellites and telescopes into space, not for reflecting calls.\n\nStep 5: The correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Step 1: The passage says that if you stood on Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.\nStep 2: It gives an example: a person who weighs 200 pounds on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds on Io.\nStep 3: The passage concludes that Io's gravity pulls less on you than Earth's gravity.\nStep 4: Let's look at the options:\n- Option 1 says Earth's gravity would pull less on you than Io's gravity. This is the opposite of what the passage says.\n- Option 2 says Io's gravity pulls more, which is why you would weigh less. This is incorrect; if gravity pulled more, you would weigh more, not less.\n- Option 3 says Io's gravity pulls more, which is why you would weigh more. This is also incorrect; the passage says you would weigh less.\n- Option 4 says Earth's gravity would pull more on you than Io's gravity. This matches the passage, which says Earth's gravity is stronger.\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n- The passage says the photographer \"attempted to take pictures of the police stop before crossing the road and continuing.\"\n- It also mentions he \"stopped his vehicle on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and attempted to take pictures of the police stop.\"\n- The police officer ordered him back across the road, indicating he was trying to get closer or get a better angle for his photos.\n- The main action the photographer was doing before being struck was attempting to take photos of the police stop.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Park on Sepulveda Boulevard – The passage says he stopped his vehicle, but the main action was not parking.\n2. Take photos of a police stop – This matches the passage directly.\n3. Cross a busy highway – He did cross the road, but the main thing he was attempting was taking photos.\n4. Convince a police officer to let him continue shooting – The passage does not mention him trying to convince the officer.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step 1: The passage says the extremists are planning suicide bomb attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.  \nStep 2: It specifically mentions \"prominent landmarks\" in both Ethiopia and Kenya as targets.  \nStep 3: The plan involves using suicide bombers to blow up these landmarks.  \nStep 4: The correct answer should reflect both the number of countries (two: Kenya and Ethiopia) and the fact that the targets are landmarks.\n\nOption analysis:\n1. Only mentions landmarks in one country – not accurate.\n2. Mentions two countries, but not specifically landmarks – partially accurate.\n3. Mentions landmarks in two countries – matches the passage exactly.\n4. Only mentions one country – not accurate.\n\nFinal answer:\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage says Kirby Muxloe Castle is \"more of a fortified house than a true castle,\" and that its \"large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long.\" This means it was not built to withstand serious attacks.\n2. It also says that in the 1480s, \"the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only required against small bands of roving marauders.\" This suggests that heavy fortification was not necessary.\n3. Option 1 says the castle had thick walls requested by Lord Hastings. The passage says the walls were thin, so this is incorrect.\n4. Option 2 says it required minimal fortification due to the peaceful nature of the country at the time. This matches the passage.\n5. Option 3 says the construction wasn’t typical for the time period, but the passage says it was \"typical for the period.\"\n6. Option 4 says it was built to sustain long and determined attacks, but the passage says it could not resist such attacks.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step 1: The passage discusses a new rule by the Komen Foundation that prevents grants to organizations under legal investigation.\n\nStep 2: It states that Planned Parenthood was disqualified from receiving grants because of a pending investigation.\n\nStep 3: The investigation is being conducted by Representative Cliff Stearns, who is part of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee under the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nStep 4: The passage specifically says the investigation is about how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the organization under legal investigation is Planned Parenthood.\n\n3",
      "Step 1: The passage describes the Triceratops' teeth as being able to crush tough branches and roots, and mentions that some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads.\n\nStep 2: The passage describes cycads as plants with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves, and a trunk.\n\nStep 3: The passage specifically says, \"A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before eating the trunk.\" This suggests that after removing the leaves, the Triceratops would eat the trunk.\n\nStep 4: The passage does not mention the Triceratops eating the root or the fruit of the cycad.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the correct answer is the trunk.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage and each option step by step:\n\n- The passage says Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.\n- In 2002, it was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano.\n- Goma is \"reasonably safe,\" but visits outside should be researched due to ongoing fighting in North Kivu.\n- Goma is a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for cheap Mountain Gorilla tracking.\n- Motorcycle taxis (boda-boda) are used to get around, with a local price of about 500 Congolese Francs.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. \"The fights in North Kivu are entertaining\"  \n   - The passage warns about fighting in North Kivu and suggests researching safety. It does not say the fights are entertaining; in fact, it implies they are dangerous. This would not be a good tip.\n\n2. \"It’s a good place for affordable Mountain Gorilla Tracking\"  \n   - The passage says Goma offers some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa. This is a good tip.\n\n3. \"Motorcycle taxis are a good way to get around\"  \n   - The passage says you can use motorcycle taxis (boda-boda) to get around, and gives the local price. This is a good tip.\n\n4. \"The base of the Nyiragongo volcano is located in the city\"  \n   - The passage says Goma is the base to climb the volcano, which means the city serves as a starting point for climbs. This is a reasonable tip.\n\nThe only option that is not a good tip is option 1, because it misrepresents the danger as entertainment.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses two main ways to travel cheaply: working while traveling or limiting expenses. The article focuses on limiting expenses.\n2. It mentions that to push expenses down close to zero, travelers must be willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability.\n3. The advice is for those who do not engage in illegal or exploitative activities.\n4. The question asks who might have a difficult time traveling on a very minimal budget.\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Someone who welcomes a challenge. The passage suggests that minimal budget travel is a challenge, so someone who welcomes a challenge would not have a difficult time.\n   - Option 2: Someone without strict time constraints. The passage says you need to sacrifice time, so not having strict time constraints would make it easier, not harder.\n   - Option 3: Someone planning to work remotely while traveling. The passage says this article is focused on those who do not work while traveling, but it doesn't say such a person would have a difficult time; rather, they are not the focus.\n   - Option 4: Someone who enjoys following an itinerary. The passage says you must be willing to sacrifice predictability, which is associated with following an itinerary. Therefore, someone who enjoys following an itinerary (predictability) might have a difficult time.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step 1: The passage says that the varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, but are mutually intelligible.\n\nStep 2: It specifically mentions that the numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some slight peculiarities that are different from the French spoken in France.\n\nStep 3: The passage also says the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.\n\nStep 4: However, it says all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned standard French in school, implying the standard French taught in schools is the same.\n\nStep 5: The passage does not mention anything about the spelling of French words being different.\n\nStep 6: Now, let's look at the options:\n1. The pronunciation of all words — The passage says only \"some words\" have different pronunciation, not all.\n2. The numbering system — The passage says this is different.\n3. The standard French taught in schools — The passage says this is the same.\n4. The spelling of some French words — The passage does not mention spelling differences.\n\nStep 7: The question asks which is not the same in France as it is in Belgium or Switzerland. The passage says the numbering system is different.\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n- The passage mentions that the United States Geological Survey map showed no earthquakes in Iceland in the week prior.\n- The Icelandic Meteorological Office reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the past 48 hours.\n- It then states: \"The significant earthquake activity resulting in the phase change had took place on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's summit caldera.\"\n- This means the phase change occurred as a result of the earthquake activity on March 10.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n3",
      "Step 1: The question asks what should be noted about a cyclical event to track the passing of time.\n\nStep 2: According to the passage, \"You can mark the passing of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event.\"\n\nStep 3: The key word here is \"repetition,\" which means something happening again and again regularly.\n\nStep 4: Let's look at the options:\n1. Duration – This refers to the length of an event, not its repetition.\n2. Repetition – This matches the passage, as it is the repetition of the event that helps track time.\n3. Affect – This is not mentioned in the context of tracking time.\n4. Difficulty – This is not relevant to cyclical events.\n\nStep 5: The correct answer is the one that matches the passage's explanation.\n\n2",
      "Step 1: The passage mentions that the document will refer to the borders dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Mideast War. This means the dispute over borders is included.\n\nStep 2: The passage says other topics covered include the future state of Jerusalem, so the future of Jerusalem is included.\n\nStep 3: The passage also discusses the Jordan Valley issue, specifically Israel's demand for a military presence and the PA's counterproposal. So, military presence in the valley is included.\n\nStep 4: The passage does not mention the cause of the 1967 war, only that the borders are based on the situation before that war.\n\nTherefore, the issue not included in the document is the cause of the 1967 war.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage and each option step by step:\n\n- The passage says: \"The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that started in October.\"  \n  This supports option 1 as true.\n\n- The passage says: \"The sometimes-violent protests were triggered by failure to hold elections, some due since 2011.\"  \n  This supports option 2 as true.\n\n- The passage says: \"Last month a presidential commission recommended the prior CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.\"  \n  It does not say that the protests themselves demanded the resignation of the prior CEP, only that the commission recommended it. So option 3 is not directly supported by the passage.\n\n- The passage says: \"The sometimes-violent protests...\"  \n  This supports option 4 as true.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not true according to the passage is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n- The passage says Jonny Reid drove over the bridge at speeds over 160km/h seven times.\n- The police had trouble using their radar guns to see how fast he was going because the car was so low.\n- The only time the police managed to clock Mr Reid was when he slowed down to 160km/h.\n- This means the police could only use their radar guns to clock his speed when he was driving at 160km/h, not when he was going faster.\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n1",
      "Step 1: The passage explains that curries are made with herbs, spices, and either meat or vegetables.\nStep 2: It mentions that curries can be \"dry\" or \"wet\" depending on the amount of liquid.\nStep 3: The passage states that in inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries.\nStep 4: It also says that in Southern India and some other coastal regions, coconut milk is commonly used.\nStep 5: The question asks: In certain regions, coconut milk is sometimes used in place of which ingredient in a curry?\nStep 6: From the passage, coconut milk is used in some regions where yogurt is used in others, suggesting coconut milk is used in place of yogurt.\n\n3",
      "Step 1: The passage gives advice specifically for women travelers in a region bounded by the Sahel and the Atlantic Ocean.\nStep 2: It recommends that women say they are married and wear a ring (but not an expensive-looking one).\nStep 3: The passage warns that what women may consider harassment is not uncommon, including being followed or grabbed by the arm.\nStep 4: It advises women to be firm in turning down men and to stand their ground, despite cultural differences.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n1. \"Recognize that it is uncommon to be followed\" – This is incorrect; the passage says it is not uncommon.\n2. \"Wear a large ring to signify marital status\" – The passage says to wear a ring, but not one that looks too expensive or large.\n3. \"Understand that cultural differences suggest that you avoid standing your ground\" – The passage says the opposite: stand your ground.\n4. \"In the case of unwanted advances, be firm with turning down men\" – This matches the passage's advice exactly.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's break down the passage step by step:\n\n- The document was adopted by Congress on July 4.\n- A handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, where copies (Dunlap broadsides) were printed.\n- The first public reading was at Independence Hall on July 8.\n- One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and read to troops in New York on July 9.\n- A copy reached London on August 10.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. New York: The broadside was read to troops in New York on July 9.\n2. Dunlap’s printing shop: The broadsides were printed there immediately after July 4.\n3. London: A copy reached London on August 10.\n4. Independence Hall: The first public reading was on July 8.\n\nComparing the dates:\n- Dunlap’s printing shop: July 4-5 (immediately after adoption)\n- Independence Hall: July 8\n- New York: July 9\n- London: August 10\n\nThe last location to receive a Dunlap broadside was London.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.\n2. It also describes a popular dish, Pa amb Oli, which includes bread, olive oil, tomato, and other condiments.\n3. Let's look at the options:\n   - Option 1: Meat – The passage says meat (especially pork) is a staple.\n   - Option 2: Bread – The passage says bread is a staple.\n   - Option 3: Grain – The passage does not mention grain as a staple.\n   - Option 4: Vegetables – The passage says vegetables are a staple.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is the one not mentioned as a main staple: grain.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage and each option step by step:\n\n- The passage explains that avalanches happen when excess snow comes down from steep slopes. It says snow is sticky, so it needs a trigger to come down.\n- It lists possible triggers: the sun warming the snow, more snowfall, other natural events, and often a human.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. Sticky snow: The passage says snow is sticky, which is why it needs a trigger. Sticky snow is not a trigger; it's the reason a trigger is needed.\n2. Humans: The passage says \"often a human\" is a trigger.\n3. Sunshine: The passage says \"the sun warming the snow\" can be a trigger.\n4. Additional snowfall: The passage says \"some more snowfall\" can be a trigger.\n\nSo, the only option that is NOT a trigger is sticky snow.\n\n1",
      "Step 1: The question asks what the Greek poet Homer was unable to do.\nStep 2: The passage describes Homer as \"the legendary blind poet.\"\nStep 3: Being blind means being unable to see.\nStep 4: The options are: 1. Hear, 2. See, 3. Walk, 4. Talk.\nStep 5: The correct answer, based on the passage, is \"see.\"\n\n2",
      "Step 1: The passage discusses comparing the total fare to Africa with a round-the-world fare.  \nStep 2: It specifically advises to \"add in the extra costs of additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.\"  \nStep 3: This means, when comparing, you should include costs for visas, departure taxes, and ground transportation for places outside Africa.  \nStep 4: The question asks what does NOT need to be added in while comparing.  \nStep 5: Let's look at the options:\n- Option 1: Cost of additional visas for places outside of Africa (the passage says to add this in)\n- Option 2: Cost of the departure taxes in Africa (the passage says to add for places outside Africa, not in Africa)\n- Option 3: Cost of an African visa (the passage does not mention adding this in)\n- Option 4: Cost of ground transportation for locations outside of Africa (the passage says to add this in)\n\nStep 6: The only cost that does NOT need to be added in, according to the passage, is the cost of an African visa.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n- Hu said, \"We will endeavour to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a notable margin by 2020 from the 2005 level.\" This mentions a date (2020) when the cuts are hoped to be achieved. So option 3 is mentioned.\n- \"He did not set a figure for the cuts, saying they will be made based on China's economic output.\" This means the basis for the cuts is China's economic output (per unit of GDP), and he did not set a specific figure. So options 1 and 4 are both mentioned.\n- \"Hu encouraged developing countries 'to avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later.' He added that 'they should not, however, be asked to take on obligations that go beyond their development stage, responsibility and capabilities.'\" This is advice to developing countries regarding pollution, so option 2 is mentioned.\n\nNow, let's check which was NOT mentioned:\n- Option 1: The basis for the cuts (mentioned)\n- Option 2: Advice to developing countries regarding pollution (mentioned)\n- Option 3: A date when carbon emissions will hopefully be cut by (mentioned: 2020)\n- Option 4: A figure for the carbon emission cuts (NOT mentioned; he specifically did not set a figure)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage says that people (which includes average citizens) would bring sacrifices to the gods, and that each temple had an open courtyard. This suggests that average citizens could be in the temple courtyard.\n2. The passage mentions ceremonies and festivals, which likely involved the public, so average citizens could attend these in the temple courtyard.\n3. The passage specifically states that the inner sanctuary could only be entered by priests, not by average citizens.\n4. Therefore, an average Babylonian citizen would not be found bringing sacrifices to the inner sanctuary, as only priests could enter there.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step 1: The question asks what will eventually cause a light bulb to stop working, according to the passage.\n\nStep 2: Let's look for information in the passage about why a light bulb stops working. The passage says: \"After hundreds of hours of operation the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works.\"\n\nStep 3: This sentence directly states that the filament burning out is the reason the bulb stops working.\n\nStep 4: Now, let's check the options:\n1. The light fixture not being turned off correctly – The passage mentions turning off the fixture for safety, not as a cause for the bulb to stop working.\n2. Having the bulb’s metal base only partially in the socket – This is mentioned as a safety hazard, not as a cause for the bulb to stop working.\n3. The filament inside the bulb burning out – This matches exactly what the passage says.\n4. The flow of electricity into the socket slowing down – The passage does not mention this as a cause.\n\nStep 5: The correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step 1: The passage describes the dress code for visiting monasteries. Women must wear skirts covering the knees and have their shoulders covered. Men must wear trousers covering the knees.\n\nStep 2: The passage says that most monasteries provide wraps for women who come unprepared, and men can borrow trousers from the stock at the entrance.\n\nStep 3: It also mentions that the clothing provided (skirts and trousers) isn't washed after every use, implying that both are available to borrow.\n\nStep 4: The options are:\n1. Skirts – mentioned as available to borrow.\n2. Shorts – not mentioned as available, and the dress code requires covering the knees, so shorts would not be appropriate.\n3. Trousers – mentioned as available to borrow.\n4. Wraps – mentioned as available to borrow.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the item not likely to be available to borrow is \"shorts,\" since they do not meet the dress code and are not mentioned as being provided.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n- The passage says the games started at 10:00am, but does not specify that South Africa improved at that time.\n- It mentions South Africa had a comfortable win against Zambia, so they did not lose to Zambia.\n- The passage states South Africa looked \"decidedly rusty\" in the game against Zambia, but \"steadily improved as the tournament progressed.\"\n- This means their improvement happened over the course of the tournament, not at a specific moment or after a specific event like tightening defense.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step 1: The question asks which process is responsible for adding genetic variation.\n\nStep 2: According to the passage, \"Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.\"\n\nStep 3: The other processes mentioned—segregation and recombination—are described as shuffling variation between pools, not adding new variation.\n\nStep 4: \"Expressed\" is not a process, but a description of a pool of variation.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the correct answer is the process that adds new genetic variation, which is mutation.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage and each option step by step:\n\n- The passage says Bobek was born in Zagreb and gained fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade.\n- He joined Partizan in 1945 and stayed until 1958.\n- He scored 403 goals in 468 appearances, and no one else has more appearances or goals for the club.\n- In 1995, he was voted the best player in Partizan's history.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. He began playing for Partizan in 1945  \n   - The passage says he joined them in 1945. This matches the information.\n\n2. He played for Zagreb prior to Partizan Belgrade  \n   - The passage only says he was born in Zagreb, not that he played for a team there.\n\n3. He played for Partizan until 1995  \n   - The passage says he stayed until 1958, not 1995.\n\n4. He gained fame after being voted Partizan’s best player  \n   - The passage says he gained fame while playing for Partizan, not after 1995.\n\nThe only correct statement is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Step 1: The passage states that children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes at a young age.\n\nStep 2: It specifically mentions that these racial stereotypes affect behavior.\n\nStep 3: The passage gives an example: children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotyped as not doing well in school tend to not do well in school after learning about the stereotype.\n\nStep 4: This example shows that the knowledge of the stereotype impacts the child's behavior (in this case, academic performance).\n\nStep 5: The passage does not mention children choosing which racial minority to identify with, their relationships with other children, or their definition of race.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the correct answer is the option that refers to behavior.\n\n2",
      "Step 1: The passage states that eBay's acquisition is the biggest in its history, indicating its significance.\nStep 2: The passage mentions that eBay hopes to \"diversify its profit sources,\" which means it wants to have more varied ways of making money.\nStep 3: The passage also says eBay wants to \"gain popularity in areas where Skype holds a strong position,\" and lists China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil as examples.\nStep 4: Looking at the options:\n- Option 1 (\"Consolidate its revenue\") is about strengthening existing revenue, but the passage talks about diversifying, not consolidating.\n- Option 2 (\"Expand into new territories\") matches the idea of gaining popularity in new regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\n- Option 3 (\"Raise its profile\") is possible, but the passage focuses more on profit sources and geographic expansion.\n- Option 4 (\"Satisfy its shareholders\") is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nThe best match is option 2.\n\n2"

      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Olympics and will be the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics.\n2. It specifically says that Beijing will host the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor skating events.\n3. It also mentions that other skiing activities will be held at the Zhangjiakou Taizicheng Ski Resort, which is about 220 km from Beijing.\n4. The question asks which of the following will NOT be held in Beijing in 2022.\n5. Option 1: Opening ceremony – The passage says this will be in Beijing.\n6. Option 2: Taizicheng Ski Resort events – The passage says these are held in Zhangjiakou, not Beijing.\n7. Option 3: Closing ceremony – The passage says this will be in Beijing.\n8. Option 4: Indoor skating events – The passage says these will be in Beijing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the event that will NOT be held in Beijing: the Taizicheng Ski Resort events.\n\n2",
      "Step 1: Analyze the passage content.\n- The passage discusses virtual teams and compares them to traditional teams.\n- It says virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.\n- Virtual team members often act as liaisons to their offline counterparts and have more autonomy, partly due to time zone differences.\n- The passage introduces the concept of an \"invisible team\" (management team to whom members report), which is a unique component of virtual teams.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the question.\n- The question asks: What similarity exists between traditional and virtual teams according to the passage?\n\nStep 3: Analyze each option.\n1. \"Both teams are expected to have the same level of work performance.\"  \n   - The passage says virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams. This implies similar expectations for work quality/performance.\n2. \"Both teams have varying degrees of autonomy in daily work.\"  \n   - The passage says virtual teams have more autonomy than traditional teams, implying a difference, not a similarity.\n3. \"Both teams report to an invisible management team.\"  \n   - The passage says the 'invisible team' is a unique component of virtual teams, not traditional teams.\n4. \"Both teams operate in the same time zone.\"  \n   - The passage says virtual teams may have meetings across different time zones, implying a difference.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct option.\n- Only option 1 is supported by the passage as a similarity.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a traditional medieval castle and how it inspires people's imagination.\n2. It mentions images such as \"马背长矛比武\" (jousting on horseback), \"宴会\" (banquets), and \"亚瑟王骑士精神\" (the spirit of King Arthur's knights).\n3. It also describes sensory memories: the sounds and smells of ancient wars, the sound of hooves on cobblestones, and the \"地牢坑\" (dungeon pits) with the smell of fear.\n4. The passage then questions whether these imaginings are based in reality and asks about the original purpose and construction of castles.\n\nNow, let's check each option:\n\n1. 地牢坑 (dungeon pit): This is explicitly mentioned in the passage.\n2. 马背长矛比武 (jousting on horseback): This is also explicitly mentioned.\n3. 骑士精神 (spirit of chivalry/knighthood): This is mentioned as \"亚瑟王骑士精神\".\n4. 骑士 (knight): The word \"骑士\" (knight) itself does not appear directly in the passage. The passage mentions \"骑士精神\" (spirit of knighthood), but not the actual \"knight\" as a person.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses Indonesian cuisine, specifically focusing on Javanese food, which originates from the central and eastern regions of Java island.\n2. It mentions that Javanese cuisine is now widespread across the archipelago and is characterized by simple seasoning methods.\n3. The passage lists the main seasonings favored by Javanese people: peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.\n4. The question asks which type of sugar is mainly used in Javanese cuisine.\n5. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: White sugar (白糖) – not specifically mentioned.\n   - Option 2: Powdered sugar (糖粉) – not mentioned.\n   - Option 3: Coconut sugar (椰子糖) – specifically mentioned in the passage as \"especially Javanese coconut sugar.\"\n   - Option 4: Brown sugar (红糖) – not mentioned.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that matches \"Javanese coconut sugar,\" which is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step 1: Analyze the passage content.\nThe passage describes a situation where passengers were waiting in high temperatures (90°F) and were given water. It mentions that the fire chief, Scott Koons, said, \"Santa Clara was very hot that day, the temperature was over 90°F.\" It also says that being stuck on the roller coaster was uncomfortable, and it took at least an hour to rescue the first person.\n\nStep 2: Identify who commented on the uncomfortable high temperature.\nThe passage specifically quotes the fire chief (消防队长) Scott Koons, who commented on the high temperature and how hot it was in Santa Clara that day.\n\nStep 3: Match the options to the correct person.\n1. Roller coaster operator – not mentioned as commenting on the temperature.\n2. Fire chief – yes, he commented on the high temperature.\n3. Passengers – they were affected but did not comment in the passage.\n4. Police chief – not mentioned.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct option.\nThe correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains that stars emit light and heat because hydrogen atoms fuse together to form heavier elements, and this process releases energy.\n2. It also mentions that scientists are trying to build reactors that generate energy in the same way, but this is a difficult problem and will take many years to solve.\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, what does fusion enable stars to do?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Form heavier elements\" — The passage does say that hydrogen atoms combine to form heavier elements, but the question is about what fusion enables stars to do, not just the process itself.\n   - Option 2: \"Build fusion reactors\" — This is about scientists, not stars.\n   - Option 3: \"Emit light and heat\" — The passage directly states that stars emit light and heat because of fusion.\n   - Option 4: \"Produce hydrogen atoms\" — The passage says hydrogen atoms are used up in fusion, not produced.\n\n5. The best answer is option 3, as the passage directly links fusion to the emission of light and heat by stars.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that traditionally, heirs to the throne would join the military directly after finishing their studies.\n2. However, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, earning a 2:2 degree (second class, second division).\n3. The key sentence is: \"查尔斯是第一个获得学位的英国王室成员。\" This translates to \"Charles was the first British royal family member to obtain a degree.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"在完成学业之前入伍\" — \"Joined the military before finishing studies.\" The passage says the tradition was to join the military after studies, but Charles did not follow this tradition. It does not say he joined before finishing studies.\n2. \"学习考古学\" — \"Studied archaeology.\" The passage says he studied archaeology, but it does not say he was the first royal to do so.\n3. \"获得学位\" — \"Obtained a degree.\" The passage explicitly says he was the first royal family member to obtain a degree.\n4. \"入读三一学院\" — \"Attended Trinity College.\" The passage says he attended Trinity College, but does not say he was the first royal to do so.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step 1: Understand the passage  \nThe passage explains that \"scaffolding instruction\" (支架式教学) is not a learning method itself, but a way to assist people who are learning something new, such as a computer program or starting a new project. Scaffolding can be provided online or offline. Teachers are a form of scaffolding, as is the virtual assistant (like the paperclip in Microsoft Office). The key idea is that scaffolding provides support, questioning, prompting, and explanations to help learners with things they might find difficult to do alone.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options  \n1. A tutorial at the start of a computer game – This is a form of scaffolding, as it helps new players learn how to play.\n2. SAT tutor – This is a person who provides support and guidance, which fits the definition of scaffolding.\n3. An independent study plan – This is a plan for someone to study on their own, without support or guidance. This does NOT fit the definition of scaffolding.\n4. A small league coach – A coach provides support, guidance, and feedback, which is scaffolding.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct answer  \nThe question asks: \"Which is NOT an example of scaffolding instruction?\"  \nOption 3, \"an independent study plan,\" is the only one that does not involve support or guidance from another person or system.\n\nFinal answer:\n3",
      "First, let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage introduces \"食宿交换网络\" (accommodation exchange networks), which connect travelers with local residents in their destination cities.\n- To join, one usually fills out an online form; some organizations may require extra verification.\n- After joining, members get access to a list (paper or online) of hosts with available rooms, sometimes with recommendations and reviews from other travelers.\n- The passage gives the example of \"沙发冲浪\" (Couchsurfing), founded in 2004, and describes how its founder, Casey Fenton, found free accommodation by contacting local students in Iceland.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: \"通过食宿交换网络向旅客提供什么？\"  \nTranslation: \"What does the accommodation exchange network provide to travelers?\"\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\n1. 与当地房东一起的住宿  \n   Translation: Accommodation with local hosts  \n   This matches the passage, which describes travelers staying with local residents.\n\n2. 廉价航班  \n   Translation: Cheap flights  \n   The passage mentions Casey Fenton found a cheap flight, but this was not provided by the network.\n\n3. 由当地向导提供的旅游活动  \n   Translation: Tours provided by local guides  \n   The passage does not mention tours or local guides.\n\n4. 与前往同一目的地的其他旅客连接  \n   Translation: Connecting with other travelers going to the same destination  \n   The passage focuses on connecting travelers with local residents, not with other travelers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 1.\n\n1",
      "First, let's analyze the passage. The passage describes two main types of tourism:\n\n1. Leisure tourism (休闲旅游): This is when people go to a place very different from their daily life to relax and have fun. Examples include beaches, theme parks, and campsites.\n2. Cultural tourism (文化旅游): This is when people visit a place specifically to learn about its history and culture. Examples include visiting landmarks and focusing on a region's cultural sites.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"参观博物馆属于以下哪种旅游类别？\"  \nThis means: \"Visiting a museum belongs to which of the following types of tourism?\"\n\nVisiting a museum is typically done to learn about history and culture, which matches the description of \"cultural tourism\" in the passage.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n1. Business tourism (商务旅游) – Not related to museums.\n2. Leisure tourism (休闲旅游) – More about relaxation and entertainment, not specifically about learning history/culture.\n3. Cultural tourism (文化旅游) – Matches the purpose of visiting museums.\n4. Outdoor tourism (户外旅游) – Not relevant, as museums are usually indoors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses \"reentry shock\" (the shock of returning home) and compares it to \"culture shock\" (the shock of entering a new culture).\n2. It says that reentry shock comes faster, lasts longer, and can be more severe than culture shock.\n3. Importantly, the passage specifically mentions: \"对于很容易适应新文化的旅行者来说，有时很难重新适应他们的本土文化。\" This means: \"For travelers who easily adapt to a new culture, it is sometimes difficult to readapt to their native culture.\"\n4. The passage explains that after living abroad for a while, you may have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.\n5. The question asks: \"According to this passage, which type of traveler might have more difficulty adapting to reentry shock?\"\n6. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Travelers who experienced particularly bad culture shock. The passage does not mention this group.\n   - Option 2: Travelers who can quickly adapt while living abroad. The passage specifically says this group may have more difficulty readapting to their home culture.\n   - Option 3: Travelers still in the honeymoon phase. The passage says the honeymoon phase is short for reentry shock, but does not say this group has more difficulty.\n   - Option 4: Travelers who lack patience. The passage does not mention this as a factor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that throwing a boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.\n2. It specifically mentions that if you want the boomerang to return to your hand, you must use a suitable boomerang that is designed to return.\n3. It also states that most boomerangs sold in Australia do not return.\n4. Beginners are advised not to throw boomerangs in strong wind.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"If thrown correctly, it will always return to your hand.\"  \n   - The passage does not say this. It says you need a suitable boomerang, and not all boomerangs return.\n\n2. \"It is more popular among locals than tourists.\"  \n   - The passage does not compare popularity between locals and tourists.\n\n3. \"There are not many boomerangs available in Australia.\"  \n   - The passage says most boomerangs in Australia do not return, not that there are few boomerangs.\n\n4. \"Only some boomerangs are able to return.\"  \n   - This matches the passage, which says you must use a suitable boomerang that can return, and most do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a rugby match in Rustenburg where South Africa (the Springboks) narrowly defeated the All Blacks (New Zealand) with a score of 21 to 20.\n2. It mentions that the All Blacks had already won the trophy two weeks prior and that this was their last match.\n3. The passage then states: \"The last match of the series will be held next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where the Springboks will face Australia.\"\n4. \"Springboks\" is the nickname for the South African rugby team.\n5. Therefore, the teams playing at Ellis Park will be South Africa (Springboks) and Australia.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n1. All Blacks and Australia — incorrect, as the All Blacks are not mentioned as playing in the last match.\n2. New Zealand and South Africa — incorrect, as they just played, and the next match is not between them.\n3. South Africa and Australia — correct, as per the passage.\n4. Springboks and All Blacks — incorrect, as this match already happened.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "First, let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage describes two types of bowing symbols: \"上弓\" (up-bow) and \"下弓\" (down-bow).\n- \"上弓\" looks like the letter V, and \"下弓\" looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.\n- \"向上\" (up-bow) means starting from the tip of the bow and pushing, while \"向下\" (down-bow) means starting from the frog (the part you hold) and pulling.\n- Up-bow produces a softer sound, down-bow produces a stronger, more determined sound.\n- You can make your own marks with a pencil, but printed musical symbols have meaning and should be respected.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Which of the following is NOT related to bowing?\"\n\nOption 1: Softer sound — The passage says up-bow produces a softer sound, so this is related to bowing.\nOption 2: Symbol that looks like a staple — The passage says the down-bow symbol looks like a staple, so this is related to bowing.\nOption 3: Stronger sound — The passage says down-bow produces a stronger sound, so this is related to bowing.\nOption 4: Starting from the frog (弓根) — The passage says down-bow starts from the frog, so this is related to bowing.\n\nAll four options seem related to bowing, but the question asks which is NOT related. Let's look more closely:\n\nOption 2 is about the appearance of the symbol, not the action of bowing itself. The other options (1, 3, 4) are about the sound or the physical action of bowing. The question is about \"拉弓\" (bowing), not the symbol's appearance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one about the symbol's appearance, which is option 2.\n\n2",
      "First, let's analyze the passage:\n\n- Martelly was sworn in as a member of a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with 9 members.\n- This is the fifth time in four years that Martelly has joined the Haitian provisional electoral council (CEP).\n- Last month, the \"presidential commission\" (总统委员会) suggested that the previous CEP resign as part of measures to move the country toward new elections.\n- The commission was Martelly's response to large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.\n- Since 2011, protests (sometimes violent) have been triggered by the failure to hold some elections on time.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Who suggested that the last CEP resign?\"\n\nOption analysis:\n1. Martelly – The passage says the \"presidential commission\" made the suggestion, not Martelly directly.\n2. Protesters – The passage does not say the protesters suggested the resignation; they protested the lack of elections.\n3. Presidential commission – The passage explicitly says \"总统委员会建议前任 CEP 辞职\" (\"the presidential commission suggested the previous CEP resign\").\n4. CEP members themselves – The passage does not say this.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes an outbreak of a disease in late July. Pigs carry the disease, and mosquitoes transmit it to humans.\n2. The Indian government responded with several measures:\n   - Placing pig traps in heavily infected areas.\n   - Distributing thousands of mosquito nets.\n   - Spraying insecticide.\n   - Promising to provide millions of encephalitis vaccines to help medical institutions prepare for the next year.\n3. However, due to lack of funds and lower priority compared to other diseases, the plan to provide vaccines to the historically worst-affected areas was postponed this year.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Insecticide (杀虫剂)\n2. Pig traps (捕猪器)\n3. Encephalitis vaccine (脑炎疫苗)\n4. Mosquito nets (蚊帐)\n\nFrom the passage, the first three measures (pig traps, mosquito nets, insecticide) were implemented immediately in response to the outbreak. The vaccine plan, however, was postponed and will be implemented later, specifically to prepare for the next year.\n\nTherefore, the last measure to be implemented is the encephalitis vaccine.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses what can help young athletes improve their performance and enjoy sports more. It mentions that while proper nutrition alone is not enough for outstanding performance, it significantly affects overall health.\n2. The passage specifically lists: maintaining a healthy energy balance, effective hydration habits, and understanding the use of nutritional supplements as ways to help athletes improve performance and enjoy sports more.\n3. The question asks which of the following is NOT a suggestion for young athletes to find more enjoyment in sports.\n4. Option 1: \"Practicing proper nutrition\" is mentioned as important in the passage.\n5. Option 2: \"Always maintaining outstanding performance\" is NOT mentioned as a suggestion. The passage says nutrition alone is not enough for outstanding performance, and the focus is on health and enjoyment, not always being outstanding.\n6. Option 3: \"Effective hydration\" is directly mentioned in the passage.\n7. Option 4: \"Maintaining a healthy energy balance\" is also directly mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "First, let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage discusses the difference between quarter-mile and half-mile races.\n- It says that as the race changes from a quarter-mile to a half-mile, speed becomes less important, and endurance (耐力) becomes absolutely important.\n- However, to be a top half-mile runner (finishing in under two minutes), you still need to be fast enough, but you must develop endurance at all costs.\n- It also mentions that cross-country running in winter and upper body training can help prepare for the running season.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Practicing cross-country running in winter.\n   - This is mentioned as helpful preparation, but not as the most important factor.\n\n2. Developing endurance rather than speed.\n   - The passage emphasizes that endurance becomes absolutely important, and you must develop it at all costs, even though some speed is still necessary.\n\n3. Finishing in under two minutes.\n   - This is a standard for being a top runner, but not the most important factor for success.\n\n4. Developing speed rather than endurance.\n   - The passage says the opposite: endurance is more important than speed for the half-mile.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, as the passage stresses the absolute importance of endurance over speed for a top half-mile runner.\n\n2",
      "Step 1: Understand the passage  \nThe passage discusses the difficulty that primates (including humans) have in meeting their amino acid (protein) needs from plant resources available on the tropical savanna. It says that although leaves and legumes are the most accessible plant protein sources, primates like us have trouble digesting these proteins unless they are cooked. If they cannot get enough protein, it leads to serious consequences like stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death. In contrast, animal foods such as ants, termites, and eggs are easy to digest and provide all the essential amino acids.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the question  \nThe question asks: According to the passage, which type of food should primates eat to solve the \"protein problem\"?\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options  \n1. 枯萎的叶子 (wilted leaves): The passage says leaves are hard to digest and do not provide enough protein unless cooked.  \n2. 生的豆科植物 (raw legumes): The passage says legumes are also hard to digest unless cooked.  \n3. 蚂蚱 (grasshoppers): This is an animal food, similar to ants and termites mentioned in the passage as being easy to digest and providing all essential amino acids.  \n4. 花茎 (flower stems): Not mentioned as a good protein source in the passage.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion  \nBased on the passage, animal foods like ants, termites, and eggs are recommended for solving the protein problem. Grasshoppers (蚂蚱) are similar to these and fit the description.\n\n3",
      "Step 1: Understand the passage.\nThe passage explains that when you call someone far away, you use satellites. The satellite in space receives the call and almost immediately reflects it back. Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and views. To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the question.\nThe question asks: Which of the following reflects long-distance calls back to Earth?\n\nStep 3: Examine the options.\n1. 望远镜 (Telescope) – The passage says telescopes are used by scientists in space to avoid atmospheric distortion, not for reflecting calls.\n2. 卫星 (Satellite) – The passage clearly states satellites receive and reflect calls back to Earth.\n3. 光线 (Light) – Light is mentioned in the context of telescopes and atmospheric distortion, not reflecting calls.\n4. 火箭 (Rocket) – Rockets are used to launch satellites and telescopes, not to reflect calls.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer.\nThe passage directly states that satellites reflect long-distance calls back to Earth.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the effect of gravity on a person standing on Io (木卫一, Jupiter's moon).\n2. It states that if you weigh 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth, you would weigh only 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io.\n3. This means the gravitational pull (牵引力) on Io is much less than on Earth.\n4. The passage concludes that gravity on Io exerts a smaller force on you.\n5. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Earth exerts less pull on you than Io\" — This is incorrect; Earth exerts more.\n   - Option 2: \"Io's pull is greater, that's why you are lighter\" — This is incorrect; a greater pull would make you heavier.\n   - Option 3: \"Io's pull is greater, that's why you are heavier\" — This is incorrect; you are lighter, not heavier, and the pull is not greater.\n   - Option 4: \"Earth exerts more pull on you than Io\" — This matches the passage: Earth's gravity is stronger, so you weigh more.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "First, let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The photographer was sent to a hospital and died.\n- He was in his 20s.\n- Justin Bieber made a statement expressing sadness for the family.\n- TMZ reported that the photographer parked on the other side of Sepulveda Avenue and started taking pictures of a police stop.\n- After crossing the street, he continued taking photos, which caused the California Highway Patrol officers to stop their work twice and order him back.\n- The police said the driver who hit the photographer may not face criminal charges.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"What was the photographer trying to do before being hit by the car?\"\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. \"Park on Sepulveda Avenue\" – The passage says he parked on the other side, but this was before the main incident. Parking was not what he was trying to do immediately before being hit.\n2. \"Take pictures of the police stop\" – The passage says he started taking pictures of the police stop, and after crossing the street, he continued taking photos. This is directly mentioned as his action before the accident.\n3. \"Cross a busy road\" – The passage says he crossed the street, but after crossing, he continued taking photos. So, crossing the road happened, but the main action before being hit was taking photos.\n4. \"Persuade the police to let him continue taking photos\" – There is no mention of him trying to persuade the police; the police ordered him back, but he did not try to persuade them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, as the passage clearly states that he was taking photos of the police stop before being hit.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, warned that \"Somali extremists\" are planning suicide bomb attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.\n2. The information received specifically mentions plans to bomb \"famous landmarks\" in both Ethiopia and Kenya using suicide bombers.\n3. The question asks which statement accurately describes the extremists' alleged attack plan.\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Bombing a landmark in one country\" — The passage mentions two countries, not just one.\n   - Option 2: \"Bombing in two countries\" — This is partially correct, but it doesn't specify the targets as landmarks.\n   - Option 3: \"Bombing landmarks in two countries\" — This matches the passage, which mentions \"famous landmarks\" in both Kenya and Ethiopia.\n   - Option 4: \"Bombing in one country\" — This is incorrect, as two countries are mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate option is:\n\n3",
      "Step 1: Analyze the passage.\n- The passage says that Muxloe Castle is more like a fortified house than a real castle.\n- It has large glass windows and thin walls, which could not withstand a determined attack for long.\n- In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings started building it, the country was relatively peaceful.\n- Only a small group of roaming raiders needed to be defended against.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option.\n1. \"The thick walls of the castle were built at the request of Lord Hastings.\"  \n   - The passage says the walls are thin, not thick. This is incorrect.\n\n2. \"Due to the peaceful nature of the country at the time, it required minimal defensive works.\"  \n   - The passage says the country was relatively peaceful and only small groups of raiders needed to be defended against, implying minimal defenses were needed. This matches the passage.\n\n3. \"The construction of the castle did not conform to the typical style of the time.\"  \n   - The passage says it was a typical building of that period, so this is incorrect.\n\n4. \"It was built to withstand a prolonged determined attack.\"  \n   - The passage says it could not withstand a determined attack for long. This is incorrect.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct option.\n- Option 2 is the only one that accurately reflects the passage.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses a new policy by the Komen Foundation, which states that they will not provide funding to organizations under legal investigation.\n2. Because of this policy, funding to \"计划生育计划\" (Planned Parenthood) was halted.\n3. The reason for the halt is that Planned Parenthood is awaiting the results of an investigation led by Congressman Cliff Stearns.\n4. Cliff Stearns is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which is under the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n5. The investigation is about whether tax money is being used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood.\n6. The question asks: \"Which organization is under legal investigation?\"\n7. From the passage, it is clear that Planned Parenthood is the organization being investigated.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the eating habits of Triceratops (三角龙). It says their teeth could crush leaves, hard branches, and roots.\n2. It mentions that some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads (苏铁), which were common in the Cretaceous period.\n3. Cycads are described as looking like small palm trees, with crowns made of sharp, nail-like leaves.\n4. The passage specifically states: \"在吃树干之前，三角龙会用它强有力的喙嘴剥去树叶。\" This means \"Before eating the trunk, Triceratops would use its strong beak to strip away the leaves.\"\n5. This suggests that Triceratops ate the trunk (树干) of the cycad, not the leaves, roots, or fruit.\n6. The passage also mentions that some scientists think the plants are poisonous, but this is not directly relevant to which part Triceratops might eat according to the main description.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes Goma, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda. It mentions that in 2002, the city was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the town, especially the center.\n2. It says that Goma is relatively safe, but travelers should research before going outside Goma to check if the fighting in North Kivu province has eased.\n3. The city is a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and for the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.\n4. It mentions that you can tour Goma by boda-boda (motorcycle taxi), and the normal local price for a short ride is 500 Congolese francs.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. 北基伍的战斗很有趣 (\"The fighting in North Kivu is interesting/fun\")  \n   - The passage does not suggest that the fighting is interesting or fun. In fact, it warns travelers to check the situation because of ongoing conflict. This is NOT good advice for tourists.\n\n2. 是便宜的追踪山地大猩猩的好地方 (\"It is a good place for cheap mountain gorilla tracking\")  \n   - The passage says Goma is the base for the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa. This is good advice.\n\n3. 出租的摩托车是一个好的交通方式 (\"Motorcycle taxis are a good means of transportation\")  \n   - The passage says you can tour Goma by boda-boda, implying it's a common and suitable way to get around. This is good advice.\n\n4. 攀登尼拉贡戈火山的基地位于城市中 (\"The base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano is in the city\")  \n   - The passage says the city is the base for climbing the volcano. This is good advice.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is NOT good advice for tourists is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses ways to travel the world with minimal expenses, focusing on reducing spending rather than working while traveling.\n2. It mentions that this approach is suitable for people willing to sacrifice comfort and time, who enjoy surprising and unpredictable travel, and who want to minimize costs.\n3. It also refers to a guide for \"minimum budget travel\" for those who are willing to accept these conditions.\n4. The passage implies that this style of travel is not for everyone; it is for those who are flexible, adventurous, and not tied to comfort or strict schedules.\n5. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: People who like challenges—these people are actually suited for this kind of travel, according to the passage.\n   - Option 2: People without strict time limits—these people are also suited, as the passage says this travel is for those willing to sacrifice time.\n   - Option 3: People planning to work remotely while traveling—the passage says it focuses on reducing expenses, not working while traveling, but doesn't say it's difficult for these people.\n   - Option 4: People who like to follow an itinerary—the passage says this travel is for those who like surprises and are willing to give up comfort and time, implying that people who like to follow a set itinerary (i.e., prefer predictability and structure) may find it difficult.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the differences between the French language as used in Belgium and Switzerland versus France.\n2. It states that the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is very similar to that in France and mutually intelligible, but there are some differences.\n3. Specifically, it mentions that the number system has some subtle peculiarities in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France, and some words are pronounced slightly differently.\n4. It also says that all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn standard French in school, so they can understand the standard French metric system.\n5. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"All word pronunciations\" — The passage says \"some words\" have different pronunciations, not all.\n   - Option 2: \"Metric system\" — The passage says they use the standard French metric system, so this is not different.\n   - Option 3: \"Standard French taught in schools\" — The passage says they all learn standard French in school, so this is not different.\n   - Option 4: \"Spelling of some French words\" — The passage does not mention spelling differences, only pronunciation and the number system.\n\n6. The passage specifically mentions differences in the number system and some word pronunciations, but not all pronunciations or spelling. The only option that matches the passage is the one about \"some word pronunciations,\" but since that's not an option, let's check which option best fits the passage.\n\n7. Option 1 is incorrect because it's not all pronunciations. Option 2 is incorrect because the metric system is the same. Option 3 is incorrect because standard French is taught everywhere. Option 4 is about spelling, which is not mentioned in the passage.\n\n8. However, the passage does mention that the number system is different, which is not directly listed as an option, but the metric system (option 2) is mentioned as being the same, not different.\n\n9. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match the passage, but the closest is option 1, since \"some word pronunciations\" are different, and option 1 says \"all word pronunciations,\" which is an exaggeration.\n\n10. However, since the passage says \"some words,\" and option 4 says \"some French word spellings,\" which is not mentioned at all, option 1 is closer to the passage content, even though it's not exact.\n\n11. But if we must choose the one that is actually different, the passage says \"some word",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions that the US Geological Survey's international earthquake map shows no earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week.\n2. The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reports no seismic activity in the Hekla region in the past 48 hours.\n3. The passage then states: \"导致相位变化的重大地震活动于 3 月 10 日发生在该火山顶部火山口的东北侧。\" This means: \"The significant seismic activity that caused the phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's summit crater.\"\n4. The question asks: \"According to this passage, when did the phase change occur?\"\n5. The options are:\n   1. Before March 10\n   2. The past 48 hours\n   3. March 10\n   4. The previous week\n\nFrom the passage, it is clear that the phase change was caused by a significant seismic event that happened on March 10. Therefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\nThe passage discusses the concept of time, how it is difficult to understand, and how it has been studied by scholars for thousands of years. It explains that time is experienced as a sequence of events from future to present to past. Importantly, it says that time is used to compare the duration (length) of events. \n\nThe key sentence for the question is: \"你可以通过观察重复的周期性事件来记录时间的流逝。周期性事件是指有规律地一次又一次发生的事。\"  \nTranslation: \"You can record the passage of time by observing repeated periodic events. Periodic events are things that happen regularly again and again.\"\n\nNow, the question asks: \"In order to record the passage of time, what aspect of periodic events should be noted?\"\n\nLet's look at the options:\n1. 持续时间 (duration)\n2. 重复 (repetition)\n3. 影响 (influence/impact)\n4. 难度 (difficulty)\n\nFrom the passage, the definition of periodic events is that they happen regularly, again and again. The passage specifically says that by observing repeated periodic events, you can record the passage of time. The key aspect here is the \"repetition\" of the events, as this regularity allows us to measure time.\n\nOption 2, \"重复\" (repetition), directly matches this idea.\n\nOption 1, \"持续时间\" (duration), is related to comparing events, but the passage emphasizes the repetition of periodic events for recording time, not their individual duration.\n\nOptions 3 and 4 (influence and difficulty) are not mentioned or relevant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage mentions that the document will refer to border disputes, and that Palestine hopes to use the pre-1967 war borders as a basis. This means border disputes are included.\n2. The passage also says that other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem (which is holy to both countries) and the Jordan Valley issue. So, the future of Jerusalem is included.\n3. Regarding the Jordan Valley, it is mentioned that Israel wants to deploy military forces there for ten years after the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to five years. So, the issue of military forces in the valley is included.\n4. The passage does NOT mention the causes of the 1967 war; it only refers to the borders before the war.\n\nNow, matching the options:\n1. The future of Jerusalem – included in the document.\n2. The causes of the 1967 war – NOT included in the document.\n3. Military forces in the valley – included in the document.\n4. Border disputes – included in the document.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that Martelly was sworn in as a member of a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with 9 members. This is his fifth time in four years.\n2. Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the previous CEP resign, as part of measures to move the country toward new elections.\n3. The commission was Martelly's response to large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.\n4. Since 2011, some elections have not been held as scheduled, which triggered these protests, and sometimes the protests turned violent.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. \"总统委员会是对抗议的回应\" — The passage says the commission was Martelly's response to the protests. This is correct.\n2. \"延误的选举引发了抗议\" — The passage says protests were triggered by elections not being held as scheduled. This is correct.\n3. \"抗议要求前任 CEP 辞职\" — The passage says the presidential commission recommended the previous CEP resign, but it does not say the protests themselves demanded the resignation of the previous CEP. The protests were about delayed elections, not specifically about the CEP resigning.\n4. \"抗议有时是暴力的\" — The passage says sometimes the protests turned violent. This is correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement about the protests is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes Jonny Reid driving a car called \"Black Beauty\" over the Auckland Harbour Bridge at speeds over 160 km/h, making history as the fastest person to legally drive on the bridge.\n2. It is mentioned that the car's chassis was too low for the police to use their radar gun to detect his speed most of the time.\n3. The passage specifically states: \"警方唯一一次成功检测到里德先生的车速，是在他将车速降到 160 公里/小时的时候。\" This translates to: \"The only time the police successfully detected Mr. Reid's speed was when he reduced his speed to 160 km/h.\"\n4. The question asks: \"When were the police able to use their radar gun to measure Jonny Reid's driving speed?\"\n5. Option 1 says: \"When he was driving at 160 km/h.\" This matches the passage.\n6. Option 2 says: \"On his seventh crossing of the bridge.\" The passage does not specify this.\n7. Option 3 says: \"When he was driving at over 160 km/h.\" The passage says the radar could not detect his speed at those times.\n8. Option 4 says: \"On his first crossing of the bridge.\" The passage does not specify this.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Step 1: Understand the passage.\nThe passage describes curry dishes, which are made mainly with herbs and spices, and can include meat or vegetables. The texture (dry or wet) depends on the amount of water. In northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. In southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the question.\nThe question asks: In some regions, coconut milk sometimes replaces which ingredient in curry?\n\nStep 3: Examine the options.\n1. Meat\n2. Vegetables\n3. Yogurt\n4. Spices\n\nStep 4: Find the relevant information.\nThe passage says that in northern India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is used in curries, while in southern India and coastal areas, coconut milk is used. This suggests that coconut milk is used instead of yogurt in those regions.\n\nStep 5: Choose the correct option.\nThe correct answer is \"yogurt,\" which is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a region bordering the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west. It gives advice specifically for female travelers.\n2. The advice includes: all female travelers should say they are married regardless of their actual status, and wearing a ring (but not an expensive-looking one) can help.\n3. It also warns that cultural differences may mean what women consider harassment (such as being followed or grabbed) is not uncommon in this region.\n4. Importantly, it advises women to be firm when rejecting men, not to be afraid to stand their ground, and to be decisive in refusing, regardless of cultural differences.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"Recognize that being followed is unusual\" — This is incorrect. The passage says being followed is not uncommon.\n2. \"Wear a big ring to show marital status\" — The passage says to wear a ring, but not one that looks too expensive or big.\n3. \"Understand cultural differences mean you should avoid standing your ground\" — This is the opposite of the advice; the passage says to stand your ground regardless of cultural differences.\n4. \"Be firm in rejecting men when faced with unwanted advances\" — This matches the passage's advice exactly: be firm, don't be afraid, and be decisive in refusing.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The handwritten draft was approved on July 4 and sent to John Dunlap's printing shop for printing. This means the Dunlap broadsides were first at the printing shop.\n2. 150 to 200 copies were printed overnight.\n3. On July 8, John Nixon publicly read the document in the yard of Independence Hall. So, the document was at Independence Hall on July 8.\n4. One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. So, the document reached New York by July 9.\n5. A copy arrived in London on August 10. This is the latest date mentioned for any location.\n\nNow, let's match the options to the timeline:\n- Dunlap's printing shop: right after July 4 (first location)\n- Independence Hall: July 8\n- New York: July 9\n- London: August 10 (latest)\n\nTherefore, the Dunlap broadside arrived in London last among the listed locations.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n3",
      "Step 1: Analyze the passage content.\n- The passage describes the main features of cuisine in Mallorca.\n- It says the cuisine is similar to other Mediterranean regions.\n- The main ingredients are bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork).\n- Olive oil is used exclusively.\n- An example dish, Pa amb Oli, is described: bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional toppings like cheese or tuna.\n\nStep 2: Examine the options.\n1. Meat – explicitly mentioned as a main ingredient.\n2. Bread – explicitly mentioned as a main ingredient.\n3. Grains – not mentioned in the passage.\n4. Vegetables – explicitly mentioned as a main ingredient.\n\nStep 3: Determine which is NOT a main feature.\n- Meat, bread, and vegetables are all directly stated as main features.\n- Grains are not mentioned at all.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct option.\n- The correct answer is the one that is NOT a main feature: Grains.\n\n3",
      "First, let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage explains that avalanches are not unusual; they happen because steep slopes can only hold a limited amount of snow, and excess snow falls as an avalanche.\n- It mentions that snow is sticky, so some trigger is needed for the snow to fall.\n- Triggers can include: sunlight warming the snow, extra snowfall, other natural events, and most commonly, human factors.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. 粘雪 (\"sticky snow\") — The passage says snow is sticky, but this is a property of snow, not a trigger for avalanches.\n2. 人类 (\"humans\") — The passage says human factors are a common trigger.\n3. 阳光 (\"sunlight\") — The passage says sunlight warming the snow can be a trigger.\n4. 额外的降雪 (\"extra snowfall\") — The passage says extra snowfall can be a trigger.\n\nSo, the only option that is NOT a trigger is option 1, \"sticky snow,\" which is a property, not a trigger.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage introduces several famous Greek figures, including politicians, scientists, and artists.\n2. It specifically mentions Homer, describing him as a \"legendary blind poet\" (\"有着传奇色彩的盲人诗人荷马\").\n3. The passage states that Homer created two masterpieces of Greek literature: \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey.\"\n4. The question asks: \"What is the Greek poet Homer unable to do?\"\n5. The options are:\n   1. Hear\n   2. See\n   3. Walk\n   4. Speak\n\nSince the passage describes Homer as a \"blind poet,\" this means he could not see.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses airlines that have expanded their services to Africa and suggests comparing the total ticket price to Africa with the price of a round-the-world ticket.\n2. It specifically says: \"对于非洲以外的所有地区，别忘了加上额外的签证费、离境税、地面交通等费用。\" This means: \"For all regions outside Africa, don't forget to add extra visa fees, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc.\"\n3. The question asks: When comparing the total ticket price to Africa with the round-the-world ticket price, which item does NOT need to be added?\n4. The options are:\n   - 1: Extra visa fees for regions outside Africa\n   - 2: Departure tax fees for Africa\n   - 3: Visa fees for Africa\n   - 4: Ground transportation fees for regions outside Africa\n5. According to the passage, for regions outside Africa, you need to add extra visa fees, departure taxes, and ground transportation fees. But for Africa, these are not mentioned as needing to be added.\n6. The question is asking which does NOT need to be added. Since the passage says to add these fees for regions outside Africa, but not for Africa, the correct answer is something that is for Africa, which does not need to be added.\n7. Option 2 (Africa departure tax) and Option 3 (Africa visa fees) are for Africa. The passage does not say to add these.\n8. However, the passage specifically says to add fees for regions outside Africa, not for Africa itself.\n9. The question is about comparing the total ticket price to Africa (which should already include Africa's own fees) with the round-the-world ticket price, and only for regions outside Africa do you need to add extra fees.\n10. Therefore, the item that does NOT need to be added is the visa fee for Africa itself, as the passage only mentions adding extra fees for regions outside Africa.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step 1: Analyze the passage content.\n- The passage quotes Hu Jintao saying that by 2020, China will strive to significantly reduce the carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP compared to 2005.\n- He did not set a specific reduction amount, only saying the amount will be determined based on China's economic output.\n- He encourages developing countries not to follow the old path of \"pollute first, clean up later.\"\n- He adds that developing countries should not be required to take on obligations beyond their stage of development, responsibility, and capability.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option.\n1. \"减排的基础\" (The basis for reduction): The passage mentions that reductions will be based on China's economic output, so the basis is mentioned.\n2. \"针对发展中国家的污染建议\" (Suggestions for developing countries regarding pollution): The passage mentions advice to developing countries not to follow the old path, so this is mentioned.\n3. \"二氧化碳排放有望削减的日期\" (The date by which CO2 emissions are expected to be reduced): The passage says \"by 2020,\" so the date is mentioned.\n4. \"二氧化碳排放削减数额\" (The amount of CO2 emission reduction): The passage explicitly says that Hu did not set a reduction amount, only that it will be determined later.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct option.\n- The only thing Hu did NOT mention is the specific amount of CO2 emission reduction.\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the structure and function of Babylonian temples. Each god had a main temple, considered the god's residence. People offered sacrifices, and priests performed rituals and festivals to satisfy the gods.\n2. Each temple had an open courtyard accessible to the public, and an inner sanctuary (内殿) that only priests could enter.\n3. Special pyramid-shaped towers (ziggurats) were part of some temples, with the top being a special holy place for the god.\n4. The question asks where ordinary Babylonians could NOT appear.\n5. Option 1: \"在神殿的庭院里献祭\" (Offering sacrifices in the temple courtyard) — The passage says people could offer sacrifices, and the courtyard was open to the public, so this is possible.\n6. Option 2: \"参加主殿的仪式\" (Participating in main temple rituals) — The passage says priests performed rituals, but it does not explicitly say ordinary people could not attend. However, it is likely that people could at least observe or participate in some way, especially in the courtyard.\n7. Option 3: \"在神殿庭院的节庆中\" (Participating in temple courtyard festivals) — The passage says festivals were held, and the courtyard was open, so this is possible.\n8. Option 4: \"在内殿里献祭\" (Offering sacrifices in the inner sanctuary) — The passage clearly states that only priests could enter the inner sanctuary, so ordinary people could not be there.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes what happens after using a light bulb for several hundred hours: \"灯丝最终被烧坏，而灯泡也不亮了。\" This means \"the filament eventually burns out, and the bulb no longer lights up.\"\n2. It then discusses the need to replace the bulb and the safety precautions to take, such as turning off the switch or disconnecting the cable, to avoid electric shock.\n3. The question asks: \"According to this passage, what ultimately causes the light bulb to stop working?\"\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"灯具未正确关闭\" (\"The lamp was not properly turned off\") — This is about safety during replacement, not the cause of the bulb stopping.\n   - Option 2: \"灯泡的金属底部只部分插入插座\" (\"The metal base of the bulb is only partially inserted into the socket\") — This is a safety hazard, not the reason the bulb stops working.\n   - Option 3: \"灯泡内部的灯丝烧坏\" (\"The filament inside the bulb burns out\") — This matches the passage, which says the filament burning out is why the bulb stops working.\n   - Option 4: \"电流进入插座的流量减缓\" (\"The flow of current into the socket slows down\") — The passage does not mention this as a cause.\n\nThe correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the dress code for visiting a monastery. Women must wear skirts that reach the knees and cover their shoulders. If they do not have appropriate clothing, the monastery provides wrap skirts (裹身衣).\n2. Men must wear long pants that cover the knees. If they do not have them, they can also borrow from the entrance.\n3. The passage mentions that skirts and wrap skirts are available for women, and long pants are available for men to borrow.\n4. It specifically says that the clothing provided is not always washed after each use and is one-size-fits-all.\n5. The question asks which type of clothing is NOT likely to be borrowed from the monastery.\n6. The options are: 1. Skirt, 2. Shorts, 3. Long pants, 4. Wrap skirt.\n7. The passage does NOT mention that shorts (短裤) are provided or allowed; in fact, it says knees must be covered, so shorts would not be appropriate or available to borrow.\n\nAnswer:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a rugby sevens tournament that started at 10 am. The weather was initially drizzly but soon cleared up, making it perfect for the game.\n2. The South African team, the top seed, started well and easily defeated Zambia (the 5th seed) with a score of 26-00.\n3. The passage then says: \"在与南方姐妹队的比赛中，南非队看起来明显有点生疏，但随着比赛的进行，南非队的表现稳步改进。\" This means: \"In the match against the southern sister team, South Africa looked a bit unfamiliar at first, but as the game went on, their performance steadily improved.\"\n4. The passage further praises their defense, ball control, and teamwork, and concludes that they are an unbeatable team.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"根据这段文字，南非队的表现何时开始改进？\" (\"According to the passage, when did the South African team's performance start to improve?\")\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. \"在上午 10 点左右\" (\"Around 10 am\") — The passage does not say their performance improved at the start time.\n2. \"加强防守之后\" (\"After strengthening their defense\") — The passage mentions their defense, but does not say improvement started after this.\n3. \"输给赞比亚之后\" (\"After losing to Zambia\") — They did not lose to Zambia; they won.\n4. \"随着比赛的进行\" (\"As the game went on\") — This matches the passage exactly: \"随着比赛的进行，南非队的表现稳步改进\" (\"as the game went on, their performance steadily improved\").\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage says: \"Mutations add new genetic variations, while selection removes variations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.\"\n- It also mentions: \"Due to segregation and recombination, variations move back and forth between the two pools in each generation.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Which process adds new genetic variation?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Segregation (分离): The passage says segregation moves variation between pools, not that it adds new variation.\n2. Recombination (重组): Similarly, recombination moves variation between pools, but does not add new variation.\n3. Mutation (突变): The passage explicitly says that mutations add new genetic variation.\n4. Dominant (显性): This is a type of genetic trait, not a process that adds variation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says Bobek was born in Zagreb, Croatia's capital, and became famous while playing for Partizan Belgrade (贝尔格莱德游击队).\n2. He joined the team in 1945 and played until 1958.\n3. During his time at the club, he played 468 matches and scored 403 goals.\n4. No one has more appearances or goals for the club than Bobek.\n5. In 1995, he was chosen as the best player in the club's history.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. 他在 1945 年开始为游击队效力  \n   Translation: He started playing for Partizan in 1945.  \n   The passage says he joined the team in 1945. This is correct.\n\n2. 他在贝尔格莱德游击队之前为萨格勒布效力  \n   Translation: He played for Zagreb before Partizan.  \n   The passage only says he was born in Zagreb, not that he played for a team there before Partizan. This is not supported.\n\n3. 他在 1995 年之前一直为游击队效力  \n   Translation: He played for Partizan until before 1995.  \n   The passage says he played until 1958, so this is incorrect.\n\n4. 他因当选为游击队最佳球员而名声大噪  \n   Translation: He became famous because he was chosen as the best player.  \n   The passage says he became famous while playing for the club, not because of the 1995 award. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Step 1: Analyze the passage content.\nThe passage discusses how children, even at a young age, can become aware of race and racial stereotypes. It specifically states that these stereotypes can influence their behavior. An example is given: if people stereotypically believe that children from a certain minority group perform poorly in school, and these children become aware of this stereotype, they often end up performing poorly in school themselves.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the question.\nThe question asks: According to the passage, which aspect might be affected by a child's understanding of racial stereotypes?\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options.\n1. The minority group they choose to identify with – The passage does not mention children choosing which minority group to identify with.\n2. Their behavior – The passage explicitly states that racial stereotypes can influence children's behavior, giving the example of school performance.\n3. Their relationships with other children – The passage does not discuss relationships with other children.\n4. Their definition of race – The passage does not discuss how children define race.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct option.\nOption 2 is directly supported by the passage.\n\n2",
      "First, let's analyze the passage. It says that this is eBay's largest acquisition ever. The company hopes to diversify its sources of profit and increase its visibility in regions where Skype is popular, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"What is the purpose of eBay's acquisition?\"\n\nOption 1: \"Consolidate its revenue\" – The passage mentions diversifying profit sources, which is related but not exactly about consolidation.\n\nOption 2: \"Expand into new fields\" – The passage does not explicitly mention entering new fields, but rather diversifying profit and increasing visibility.\n\nOption 3: \"Increase visibility\" – The passage directly states that eBay wants to increase its visibility in certain regions.\n\nOption 4: \"Satisfy shareholders' demands\" – There is no mention of shareholders in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option 3, as it directly matches the passage's statement about increasing visibility.\n\n3"

      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains that Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere, so its seasons are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere.\n2. In Montevideo, summer is when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.\n3. The passage states that in the summer months, temperatures over 30°C are common.\n4. It also says that winter can feel deceptively cold, not because of low temperatures, but because of wind and humidity, which make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.\n5. The question asks: When should travelers visit Montevideo if they want to avoid wind?\n6. The passage specifically mentions wind as a factor in winter, making it feel colder.\n7. There is no mention of wind being a problem in summer.\n8. There are no pronounced wet or dry seasons, so \"Trockenzeit\" (dry season) is not applicable.\n9. Therefore, to avoid wind, travelers should avoid winter in Montevideo, which is during the summer months in the northern hemisphere.\n10. So, the best time to visit to avoid wind is during the summer months in the northern hemisphere, which is winter in Montevideo.\n\nOption analysis:\n1. \"During the winter months in the northern hemisphere\" = summer in Montevideo (likely less wind)\n2. \"During the dry season in Montevideo\" = no such season\n3. \"During the summer months in the northern hemisphere\" = winter in Montevideo (windy)\n4. \"During the winter months in Montevideo\" = windy\n\nThe correct answer is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says: \"Der Amazonas ist der zweitlängste und der wasserreichste Fluss der Erde.\"  \n   Translation: The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river on Earth.\n\n2. \"Er führt mehr als achtmal so wie Wasser wie der zweitgrößte Strom.\"  \n   Translation: It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.\n\n3. \"Der Amazonas ist auch der breiteste Fluss der Erde, teilweise bis zu sechs Meilen breit.\"  \n   Translation: The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.\n\n4. \"Ganze 20 Prozent des Wassers, das über die Flüsse des Planeten in die Ozeane fließt, kommt aus dem Amazonas.\"  \n   Translation: 20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.\n\n5. \"Der Amazonas-Hauptstrom ist 6387 km (3980 Meilen) lang.\"  \n   Translation: The main stream of the Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles) long.\n\n6. \"Es nimmt Wasser von tausenden kleineren Flüssen in sich auf.\"  \n   Translation: It takes in water from thousands of smaller rivers.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Was trifft auf den Amazonas nicht zu?\"  \nTranslation: What is NOT true about the Amazon?\n\nOptions:\n1. Er ist der zweitlängste Fluss (He is the second longest river)  \n   - The passage says this is true.\n\n2. Er ist der größte Fluss (He is the largest river)  \n   - \"Größte\" can be ambiguous, but in the context of water volume, the passage says it is the most water-rich, so this could be considered true.\n\n3. Er ist der längste Fluss (He is the longest river)  \n   - The passage says it is the second longest, not the longest. So this is NOT true.\n\n4. Er ist der breiteste Fluss (He is the widest river)  \n   - The passage says this is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the statement that is NOT true about the Amazon, which is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Let's analyze the passage. It says that especially in summer, you have to be careful about mosquitoes when walking through the rainforest. Even if you drive through the subtropical rainforest by car, just a few seconds with the doors open while getting in is enough to let mosquitoes into the car.\n\n2. The question asks: According to the passage, what should you NOT do to avoid mosquitoes during a drive through the rainforest?\n\n3. Let's look at the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Die Türen des Autos zu lange offen lassen\" (Leave the car doors open too long). The passage specifically mentions that even a few seconds with the doors open is enough for mosquitoes to get in, so you should NOT leave the doors open too long.\n   - Option 2: \"Während der Sommermonate fahren\" (Drive during the summer months). The passage says mosquitoes are especially a problem in summer, but it doesn't say you should avoid driving then, just that you need to be careful.\n   - Option 3: \"Durch subtropische Gebiete fahren\" (Drive through subtropical areas). The passage is about the subtropical rainforest, but it doesn't say you should avoid these areas entirely.\n   - Option 4: \"Das Fahrzeug während Wanderungen unbeaufsichtigt lassen\" (Leave the vehicle unattended during hikes). The passage doesn't mention anything about leaving the vehicle unattended.\n\n4. The question is asking what you should NOT do to avoid mosquitoes. The passage clearly warns against leaving the car doors open too long, as this allows mosquitoes to enter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage explains that golf is a game where players use clubs to hit balls into holes.\n- In a typical round, there are eighteen holes, and players start at the first and end at the eighteenth.\n- The winner is the player who needs the fewest \"Schläge oder Schwünge mit dem Schläger\" (strokes or swings with the club) to complete the course.\n- The game is played on grass, and the area around the hole is called the \"Grün\" (green).\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Das Ziel beim Golf ist es, die geringste Menge wovon zu erreichen?\"  \nTranslation: \"The goal in golf is to achieve the lowest amount of what?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Bälle (balls) – The number of balls is not what is minimized; players use the same ball unless they lose it.\n2. Schläge (strokes) – The passage says the winner is the one who needs the fewest strokes to complete the course.\n3. Zeit (time) – Time is not mentioned as a factor in winning.\n4. Löcher (holes) – The number of holes is fixed; players play all holes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, \"Schläge\" (strokes).\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that the suspect is being investigated for trespassing rather than vandalism.\n2. It specifically states: \"Der Schriftzug wurde nicht physisch beschädigt.\" This means \"The sign was not physically damaged.\"\n3. The change was made using black tarps (Planen) printed with peace signs and hearts to change the \"O\" to a small \"e.\"\n4. So, the suspect used tarps, decorated with peace signs and hearts, to alter a letter in the sign, but did not physically damage it.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Einen Buchstaben ändern\" – To change a letter. The suspect did this (changed \"O\" to \"e\").\n2. \"Es mit einem Friedenszeichen verzieren\" – To decorate it with a peace sign. The tarps had peace signs, so this was done.\n3. \"Es physisch beschädigen\" – To physically damage it. The passage says this was NOT done.\n4. \"Planen benutzen, um es zu ändern\" – To use tarps to change it. The suspect did this.\n\nSo, the only thing the suspect did NOT do is option 3: physically damage the sign.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses two main points: \n   - Historians have criticized the FBI for focusing its resources on easy-to-solve cases (like car theft) to boost its success rate.\n   - In August 2005, Congress began funding the anti-obscenity initiative and required the FBI to assign 10 agents to adult pornography cases.\n\n2. The question asks: \"What must the FBI do because of the anti-obscenity initiative?\"\n\n3. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Concentrate more resources on cases of stolen vehicles\" — This relates to the earlier criticism, not the anti-obscenity initiative.\n   - Option 2: \"Increase the agency's success rate\" — This is a general goal, not a specific requirement of the anti-obscenity initiative.\n   - Option 3: \"Focus on crimes that should be easy to solve\" — Again, this is part of the earlier criticism, not the new initiative.\n   - Option 4: \"Assign agents to cases of pornography\" — The passage specifically says Congress required the FBI to assign 10 agents to adult pornography cases as part of the anti-obscenity initiative.\n\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that matches the specific requirement from the anti-obscenity initiative.\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses a debate triggered by spending on emergency aid and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina.\n2. It mentions that some fiscally conservative people humorously called this spending \"Bush's New Orleans Deal.\"\n3. The passage then states: \"Die Kritik der Liberalen am Wiederaufbauprozess hat sich darauf konzentriert, dass Aufträge für den Wiederaufbau an vermeintliche Insider in Washingtoner vergeben wurden.\"\n4. Translated: \"The criticism of liberals regarding the reconstruction process focused on the fact that contracts for reconstruction were allegedly awarded to insiders in Washington.\"\n5. The question asks: Who criticizes the reconstruction contracts for emergency aid after Hurricane Katrina?\n6. According to the passage, it is the liberals who criticize the awarding of reconstruction contracts.\n\nAnswer:\n2",

The question asks how, according to the passage, the chakras are opened in the \"center\" of Tibetan meditation.\n\nThe passage says: \"Im Zentrum der tibetischen Meditation steht das Götter-Yoga. Durch die Visualisierung verschiedener Gottheiten werden die Energiekanäle gereinigt, die Chakren geöffnet und das erleuchtete Bewusstsein entsteht.\"  \nTranslation: \"At the center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.\"\n\nSo, the chakras are opened through the visualization of deities.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n1. Through various yoga poses – This is mentioned earlier in the passage as part of Kundalini Yoga, not specifically as the central method in meditation.\n2. Visualization of deities – This matches exactly what the passage says about the center of Tibetan meditation.\n3. Repetition of mantras – Also mentioned as part of Kundalini Yoga, but not as the central method in meditation.\n4. Breathing exercises – Also part of Kundalini Yoga, not the central method in meditation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage is about \"Verkehrsfluss\" (traffic flow), which is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.\n2. It mentions that studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.\n3. However, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently, so traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.\n4. To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.\n5. These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Welche der folgenden Möglichkeiten wird genutzt, um einen Verkehrsstrom mathematisch darzustellen?\"  \nTranslation: \"Which of the following options is used to mathematically represent a traffic flow?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Straßenbetrieb (road operation) – This is about the operation of the road, not a property used in mathematical representation.\n2. Fahrerverhalten (driver behavior) – While driver behavior affects traffic flow, the passage says it cannot be predicted with certainty and is not directly used for mathematical representation.\n3. Straßendesign (road design) – This is about the design of the road, not a property used in mathematical representation.\n4. Verkehrsdichte (traffic density) – The passage specifically mentions \"density\" as one of the three main properties (flow, density, speed) used to mathematically represent traffic flow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the origins of Sanskrit, mentioning the Aryan migration and comparing Sanskrit to Latin in Europe.\n2. It states that Sanskrit is an old, complex, and rich language, and that it served as a source for many modern Indian languages, similar to how Latin is the source for many European languages.\n3. The key sentence for the question is: \"Nach der Sammlung der Upanishaden wich das Sanskrit aus hierarchischen Gründen zurück.\" This translates to: \"After the collection of the Upanishads, Sanskrit receded for hierarchical reasons.\"\n4. The question asks: \"For what reason did Sanskrit recede according to the passage?\"\n5. Looking at the options:\n   - 1. Complexity: The passage mentions Sanskrit is complex, but does not say it receded because of this.\n   - 2. Aryan migration: This is mentioned as an origin, not a reason for receding.\n   - 3. Latin languages: This is a comparison, not a reason.\n   - 4. Hierarchy: The passage explicitly says \"aus hierarchischen Gründen\" (for hierarchical reasons).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how ancient China marked different eras, each ruled by a dynasty, and mentions periods of instability between dynasties.\n2. It specifically highlights the \"Epoche der Drei Königreiche\" (Era of the Three Kingdoms), which occurred between the Han and Jin dynasties.\n3. The passage states: \"Die Zeit der drei Königreiche war eine der blutigsten Epochen in der Geschichte des alten China.\" This translates to \"The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China.\"\n4. The question asks: \"Which of the following eras was, according to the passage, one of the bloodiest in China?\"\n5. The options are:\n   1. The Jin Dynasty\n   2. The Xi'an Era\n   3. The Han Dynasty\n   4. The Era of the Three Kingdoms\n6. Based on the passage, the correct answer is clearly the Era of the Three Kingdoms.\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage states that goats were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.\n2. Ancient cultures and tribes kept goats as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and skin.\n3. Goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or pastures, supervised by goatherds (often children or adolescents).\n4. These herding methods are still used today.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Was war kein Grund, aus dem in antiken Kulturen Ziegen gehalten wurden?\"  \nTranslation: \"What was NOT a reason why goats were kept in ancient cultures?\"\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. Versorgung mit Fleisch (Provision of meat)  \n   - The passage explicitly mentions meat as one of the resources obtained from goats.\n\n2. Hilfe beim Weiden des Landes (Help with grazing the land)  \n   - The passage does not mention goats being kept to help with grazing the land (as in, to improve or manage the land). It only mentions that goats grazed, but not that this was a reason for keeping them.\n\n3. Sie boten Gesellschaft (They provided companionship)  \n   - The passage does not mention companionship as a reason for keeping goats.\n\n4. Versorgung mit Milch (Provision of milk)  \n   - The passage explicitly mentions milk as a resource obtained from goats.\n\nNow, between options 2 and 3, both are not mentioned as reasons. However, \"Hilfe beim Weiden des Landes\" (help with grazing the land) could be interpreted as a possible side effect, but not a stated reason. \"Sie boten Gesellschaft\" (they provided companionship) is not mentioned at all and is not implied.\n\nThe question asks for a reason that was NOT a reason for keeping goats. The best answer is the one that is not mentioned or implied at all.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses \"Rückkehrschock\" (reverse culture shock), which occurs when someone returns to their home country after spending time abroad.\n2. It states that reverse culture shock comes earlier than culture shock, lasts longer, and can be more severe.\n3. It specifically mentions that travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readapt to their home culture.\n4. The passage explains that after adapting to a new culture, people may have abandoned some behaviors from their home culture.\n5. It also notes that when first traveling abroad, people are patient and understanding with travelers, but this patience is not always extended to those returning home.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Was fällt Reisenden mit einem Rückkehrschock schwer?\" (\"What do travelers with reverse culture shock find difficult?\")\n\nOption analysis:\n1. \"Sich an die Kultur eines neuen Ortes anzupassen\" (\"Adapting to the culture of a new place\") – The passage says the opposite: these travelers found it easy to adapt to a new culture.\n2. \"Geduldig und verständnisvoll zu sein\" (\"Being patient and understanding\") – The passage does not mention that travelers themselves have trouble being patient or understanding.\n3. \"Ins Ausland zu reisen\" (\"Traveling abroad\") – The passage does not mention that traveling abroad is difficult for them.\n4. \"Sich wieder an die Herkunftskultur anzupassen\" (\"Readapting to their home culture\") – The passage explicitly states that this is what travelers with reverse culture shock find difficult.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains the principle behind the atomic bomb. It says that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons, similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill.\n2. It then states that when the nucleus is split again, some of this energy is released.\n3. It also mentions that some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they can decay with little or no external trigger.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"What happens, according to the passage, when an atomic nucleus is split?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. \"Protons are gained\" – The passage does not mention gaining protons when a nucleus is split.\n2. \"Energy is released\" – The passage explicitly says that when the nucleus is split, some of the energy used to assemble it is released.\n3. \"Atoms become unstable\" – The passage says some atoms are already unstable, but it does not say that splitting the nucleus makes them unstable.\n4. \"Neutrons are lost\" – The passage does not mention the loss of neutrons specifically when splitting the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, as it directly matches the information in the passage.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Let's analyze the passage for the main features and offerings of these hotels:\n   - The passage mentions the hotels' heritage, dating back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners.\n   - It highlights that the rich and famous used to stay there, enjoying good food and nightlife.\n   - The hotels are characterized by antique furnishings, lack of modern conveniences, and an elegant agedness.\n   - Sometimes, they host heads of state and dignitaries.\n   - Wealthy travelers might choose to visit many of these hotels on a world trip.\n\n2. Now, let's look at the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Antike Einrichtungen im Haus\" (Antique furnishings in the house) — The passage specifically mentions antique furnishings as a characteristic.\n   - Option 2: \"Ein Restaurant mit einem ausgezeichneten Koch\" (A restaurant with an excellent chef) — The passage says guests enjoyed good food, which implies a good restaurant, possibly with a good chef.\n   - Option 3: \"Eine Lounge mit abendlicher Unterhaltung\" (A lounge with evening entertainment) — The passage mentions nightlife, which could include evening entertainment in a lounge.\n   - Option 4: \"Günstige Zimmerpreise\" (Affordable room prices) — The passage talks about the rich and famous, very wealthy travelers, and does not mention anything about affordable prices. In fact, it implies exclusivity and luxury.\n\n3. Therefore, the offering that is least emphasized or not present in the passage is affordable room prices.\n\nFinal answer:\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage says: \"Der 28-jährige Vidal war vor drei Spielzeiten von Sevilla zu Barça gekommen. Seit seinem Umzug in die katalanische Hauptstadt hatte Vidal für den Verein 49 Partien gespielt.\"\n- Translation: \"The 28-year-old Vidal came to Barça from Sevilla three seasons ago. Since his move to the Catalan capital, Vidal has played 49 matches for the club.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the question:\n\n- \"Wie viele Partien hat Vidal für Barça gespielt?\" \n- Translation: \"How many matches has Vidal played for Barça?\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. 49\n2. 39\n3. 3\n4. 29\n\nFrom the passage, it clearly states that Vidal has played 49 matches for the club.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that Timbuktu has become a metaphor for exotic, distant lands due to its relative inaccessibility.\n2. It mentions that Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction and has an airport.\n3. It states that nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished city.\n4. In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.\n5. It was featured in Louis Gates' PBS special \"Wonders of the African World.\"\n6. The city is in strong contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Die Stadt hat eher ein arabisches Flair als der Rest des Landes\"  \n   - The passage directly says this is true.\n\n2. \"Die Stadt ist verarmt\"  \n   - The passage says it is an impoverished city, so this is true.\n\n3. \"Die Stadt ist nicht per Flugzeug zu erreichen\"  \n   - The passage says Timbuktu has an airport, so it can be reached by plane. This statement is NOT true according to the passage.\n\n4. \"Die Stadt ist immer noch eine Attraktion für neugierige Touristen\"  \n   - The passage says it is considered a tourist attraction, so this is true.\n\nTherefore, the description that does NOT apply to Timbuktu is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. **Bus Departure Times:**  \n   - Buses leave all day from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river).\n   - Most buses, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.\n\n2. **Ticket Purchase Advice:**  \n   - Inter-district buses are often full.\n   - It is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.\n\n3. **Bus Types:**  \n   - Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.\n\n4. **Alternative Transport:**  \n   - Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro and Punakha.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. **Option 1: Reisende in Richtung Jakar, die bereits ein Ticket gekauft haben**  \n   - Travelers to Jakar who have already bought a ticket.\n   - This matches the advice: Jakar is a destination with early buses (06:30-07:30), and buying a ticket in advance is recommended.\n\n2. **Option 2: Reisende in Richtung Bumthang, die bis 7 Uhr abreisen müssen**  \n   - Travelers to Bumthang who must leave by 7:00.\n   - Buses to Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30, so leaving by 7:00 is possible, but the passage doesn't say it's ideal to leave by 7:00 specifically.\n\n3. **Option 3: Reisende in Richtung Paro, die nach 11 Uhr abreisen müssen**  \n   - Travelers to Paro who must leave after 11:00.\n   - The passage suggests using shared taxis for Paro, not buses, so this is not ideal for bus travelers.\n\n4. **Option 4: Reisende in Richtung Osten, die vor 6:20 Uhr am Bahnhof ankommen**  \n   - Travelers to the east who arrive at the station before 6:20.\n   - Buses to the east leave between 06:30 and 07:30, so arriving before 6:20 is early, but the passage doesn't say this is ideal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe ideal situation, according to the passage, is for travelers to Jakar (a main destination) who have already bought a ticket in advance, as buses are often full and advance purchase is recommended.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the traditional path for the heir to the throne, which was to go directly to the military after finishing school.\n2. However, Charles did not follow this tradition. Instead, he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, at Trinity College in Cambridge.\n3. He graduated with a 2:2, which is a degree without special distinction.\n4. The key sentence is: \"Charles war das erste Mitglied der britischen Königsfamilie, dem ein Hochschulabschluss verliehen wurde.\" This translates to: \"Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a university degree.\"\n5. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Vor Abschluss der Schule zum Militär zu gehen\" (\"To go to the military before finishing school\") – This is not what Charles did; it's the traditional path, but not what made him the first.\n   - Option 2: \"Archäologie zu studieren\" (\"To study archaeology\") – The passage does not say he was the first to study archaeology.\n   - Option 3: \"Einen Hochschulabschluss\" (\"A university degree\") – The passage explicitly states he was the first royal family member to receive a university degree.\n   - Option 4: \"Besuch des Trinity College\" (\"Attending Trinity College\") – The passage does not say he was the first to attend Trinity College, only the first to get a degree.\n\nThe correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says: \"Nach dem Unfall wurde Gibson in ein Krankenhaus gebracht, er verstarb jedoch kurz darauf.\"  \n   Translation: After the accident, Gibson was taken to a hospital, but he died shortly afterwards.  \n   This means Gibson was injured in the accident (since he was taken to the hospital and died).\n\n2. \"Der LKW-Fahrer, der 64 Jahre alt ist, wurde bei dem Unfall nicht verletzt.\"  \n   Translation: The truck driver, who is 64 years old, was not injured in the accident.  \n   So, the truck driver was not injured.\n\n3. \"Eine Person, die in einer Werkstatt in der Nähe des Unfallortes arbeitete, sagte: ...\"  \n   This person is just a witness, not mentioned as being injured.\n\n4. \"Es gab Kinder, die darauf warteten, die Straße zu überqueren, und alle schrien und weinten. Sie alle rannten zurück vom Unfallort.\"  \n   Translation: There were children waiting to cross the street, and they all screamed and cried. They all ran back from the accident site.  \n   The children were scared but not mentioned as being injured.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Gibson\n2. A workshop employee\n3. Children\n4. A truck driver\n\nBased on the passage, only Gibson was injured (and died).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions that \"Mit den Kommentaren, die live im Fernsehen abgegeben wurden, gaben hochrangige iranische Quellen zum ersten Mal zu, dass die Sanktionen Wirkung zeigen.\"  \n   Translation: \"With the comments made live on television, high-ranking Iranian sources admitted for the first time that the sanctions are having an effect.\"\n\n2. The passage then discusses the types of sanctions (financial restrictions and an EU oil export ban) and their impact on the Iranian economy.\n\n3. The OPEC is mentioned as reporting the drop in oil exports, but not as admitting the effect of sanctions.\n\n4. Ayatollah Ali Chamenei is quoted as describing the dependence on oil as a \"trap,\" but not as admitting the effect of sanctions.\n\n5. The European Union is mentioned as imposing sanctions, not as admitting their effect.\n\nTherefore, the only group that admitted the effect of the sanctions, according to the passage, is the \"high-ranking Iranian sources.\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage states that the official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.\n2. About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, but the vast majority understands it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.\n3. Most signs are only in Catalan because it is legally established as the first official language.\n4. Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.\n5. Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced in multiple languages.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Why is Catalan frequently used for signs and announcements in Barcelona?\"\n\nOption 1: \"The vast majority understands it.\"  \n- The passage does say that the majority understands Catalan, but this is not given as the main reason for its use on signs and announcements.\n\nOption 2: \"It was the first official language of the city.\"  \n- The passage explicitly states that most signs are only in Catalan because it is legally established as the first official language. This is the direct reason given.\n\nOption 3: \"It is the preferred language in Barcelona.\"  \n- The passage says about half prefer Catalan, but this is not the main reason for its use on signs and announcements.\n\nOption 4: \"The metro and other public facilities are usually used by residents who speak Catalan.\"  \n- The passage does not state this as a reason.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, as it directly matches the explanation in the passage.\n\n2",

It says things will become clear once you arrive, and you will meet other \"Boot-Tramper\" (boat hitchhikers) who will share their knowledge.\n3. The passage suggests offering your help, walking around the docks, approaching people cleaning their yachts, making contact with sailors in the bar, etc.\n4. It specifically says to try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and you will get tips about which boat is looking for someone.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Kontakt mit Seeleuten aufnehmen\" – Make contact with sailors. This matches the passage, which says to make contact with sailors in the bar.\n2. \"Nicht auffallen\" – Not stand out. The passage suggests the opposite: to talk to as many people as possible.\n3. \"Sich nur Menschen nähern, die ihre Yachten reinigen\" – Only approach people cleaning their yachts. The passage says to approach these people, but also to do other things, not only this.\n4. \"Andere Tramper vermeiden\" – Avoid other hitchhikers. The passage says to meet other boat hitchhikers and share knowledge, so this is not correct.\n\nThe best answer is option 1, as it directly matches the advice in the passage.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching across Bangladesh and India.\n2. It mentions that the Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n3. Importantly, the passage states: \"Der Teil des Waldes, der innerhalb des indischen Staatsgebietes liegt, wird als Sundarbans National Park bezeichnet.\" This translates to: \"The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.\"\n4. The other options:\n   - \"Das Tierschutzgebiet\" means \"the wildlife sanctuary,\" but the passage does not specify this as the Indian part.\n   - \"Die Weltkulturerbestätte\" means \"the World Heritage Site,\" which refers to the whole area, not just the Indian part.\n   - \"Die Gangesebene\" means \"the Ganges plain,\" which is a much larger region and not specific to the Indian part of the Sundarbans.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that directly matches the description in the passage: \"Sundarbans National Park.\"\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses buying glasses in other countries, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower, making glasses cheaper.\n2. It suggests having an eye exam in your home country (possibly covered by insurance) and then using the prescription abroad.\n3. The passage specifically mentions high-quality brand frames (\"hochwertige Markenfassungen\") available in such regions may have two problems:\n   - Some may be fakes (\"Fälschungen\").\n   - The genuine, imported ones may be more expensive than in your own country.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Was kann ein mögliches Risiko beim Kauf von hochwertigen Markenfassungen im Ausland sein?\"  \nTranslation: \"What could be a possible risk when buying high-quality brand frames abroad?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. \"Es kann eine zusätzliche Augenuntersuchung notwendig sein\" – \"An additional eye exam may be necessary.\"  \n   The passage does not mention this as a risk related to buying brand frames abroad.\n\n2. \"Das Rezept gilt möglicherweise nicht für bestimmte Fassungen\" – \"The prescription may not be valid for certain frames.\"  \n   The passage does not mention this.\n\n3. \"Sie können eine Fälschung sein\" – \"They can be a fake.\"  \n   The passage explicitly states that some high-quality brand frames available in such areas may be fakes.\n\n4. \"Die Versicherung deckt die Kosten eventuell nicht ab\" – \"The insurance may not cover the costs.\"  \n   The passage mentions insurance in relation to the eye exam, not the frames.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",

      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\nThe passage discusses stereotypes about Parisians. It says that Parisians are said to be egocentric, rude (\"unhöflich\"), and arrogant (\"arrogant\"). It also mentions that this is often just an inaccurate cliché. The passage then advises that behaving well (\"bien élevé\" = well-mannered) will help you get along in Paris, and that the harsh exterior (\"barsche Äußere\") of Parisians disappears quickly if you show basic manners.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Was ist dem Abschnitt nach keine stereotypische Eigenschaft der Pariser?\"  \nTranslation: \"According to the passage, which is NOT a stereotypical characteristic of Parisians?\"\n\nOptions:\n1. Arrogance (\"Arroganz\") – This is mentioned as a stereotype.\n2. Rudeness (\"Unhöflichkeit\") – This is also mentioned as a stereotype.\n3. Playfulness (\"Verspieltheit\") – This is NOT mentioned in the passage.\n4. Harshness (\"Schroffheit\") – The passage refers to a \"barsches Äußere,\" which means a harsh or rough exterior, so this is implied.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is NOT a stereotypical characteristic according to the passage is \"Verspieltheit\" (playfulness).\n\n3",

Now, let's look at each option:\n   - Option 1: \"It was prosecuted in the state where AOL is based.\"  \n     The passage says the case was prosecuted in Virginia because AOL is based there. This is correct.\n   - Option 2: \"There was a conviction.\"  \n     The passage says this is the first time a conviction was achieved under the 2003 legislation. This is correct.\n   - Option 3: \"In this case, the legislation on spam emails was used.\"  \n     The passage says the 2003 anti-spam legislation was applied. This is correct.\n   - Option 4: \"AOL was sued.\"  \n     The passage says AOL initiated the lawsuit (\"die Firma, die die Klage auf den Weg gebracht hat\"), meaning AOL was the plaintiff, not the defendant. So, AOL was not sued; AOL sued someone else. This statement is NOT true.\n\n3. The question asks: \"Which of the following statements about the case is NOT true?\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a scientific project that is mostly theoretical, but also involves writing a program to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.\n2. The effect the team is searching for is caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the Sagittarius galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.\n3. The passage compares this to how the Moon causes tides on Earth, but here, the Milky Way exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.\n4. The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as normal matter does.\n5. The theory mentioned says that most dark matter is in a halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Wissenschaftler, die an dem Programm arbeiten, hoffen Effekte wovon zu finden?\"  \nTranslation: \"Scientists working on the program hope to find effects of what?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Normale Materie (Normal matter) – The passage says the effect is not about normal matter, but about dark matter.\n2. Gezeiten (Tides) – The passage mentions tidal forces, but specifically tidal forces between dark matter components.\n3. Kleine Partikel (Small particles) – The passage says dark matter consists of small particles, but the effect being searched for is not about the particles themselves.\n4. Dunkle Materie (Dark matter) – The passage repeatedly emphasizes that the effect is due to dark matter interactions, specifically tidal forces between dark matter in two galaxies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes an incident involving a Twin Otter aircraft (PNG-Flug CG4684) that attempted to land in Kokoda but was unsuccessful.\n2. It mentions that about ten minutes before it was supposed to land on the second approach, the plane disappeared.\n3. The crash site was found later, and it was very inaccessible, requiring police to be dropped into the jungle to reach it.\n4. Importantly, the passage states: \"Die Suche wird durch die gleichen schlechten Wetterbedingungen behindert, die auch zur der verunglückten Landung führten.\" This translates to: \"The search is being hampered by the same bad weather conditions that also led to the failed landing.\"\n5. The question asks: \"Wodurch musste Flug CG4684 die Landung abbrechen?\" which means \"Why did flight CG4684 have to abort the landing?\"\n6. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: The landing site was inaccessible. (The passage says the crash site was inaccessible, not the landing site.)\n   - Option 2: There were several other planes before CG4684. (No mention of this in the passage.)\n   - Option 3: The plane was diverted to Kokoda. (The plane was trying to land in Kokoda, not diverted there.)\n   - Option 4: The weather conditions were bad. (The passage explicitly states that bad weather conditions led to the failed landing.)\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes hotels with a long heritage, dating back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th century.\n2. These hotels were frequented by the rich and famous, who enjoyed good food and nightlife there.\n3. The passage mentions \"antiken Einrichtungen\" (antique furnishings), \"Nichtvorhandensein moderner Bequemlichkeiten\" (absence of modern conveniences), and \"eine gewisse elegante Bejahrtheit\" (a certain elegant agedness) as characteristics of these hotels.\n4. Although usually privately owned, these hotels sometimes host heads of state and other dignitaries.\n5. Wealthy travelers might choose to travel the world, staying at many of these hotels.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"Eine Cocktail-Bar\" (A cocktail bar): The passage mentions nightlife and the rich and famous enjoying themselves, so a cocktail bar is likely present.\n2. \"Ein Gourmet-Restaurant vor Ort\" (A gourmet restaurant on site): The passage mentions good food, so a gourmet restaurant is likely.\n3. \"Bekannte oder berühmte andere Gäste\" (Famous or well-known other guests): The passage specifically says the rich and famous stayed there, so this is likely.\n4. \"Neu renovierte Zimmer mit modernen Annehmlichkeiten\" (Newly renovated rooms with modern amenities): The passage specifically says the hotels have antique furnishings and lack modern conveniences, so this is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a hostage situation in Manila, where a former police officer, Rolando Mendoza, took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus.\n2. He shot at the tourists, and there were at least six confirmed deaths, but several hostages were rescued.\n3. The passage says: \"Sechs Geiseln, darunter die Kinder und Ältere, wurden, wie auch die philippinischen Fotografen, frühzeitig freigelassen.\" \n   - Translation: \"Six hostages, including the children and elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.\"\n4. It also says: \"Die Fotografen nahmen den Platz einer älteren Dame ein, als sie zur Toilette musste.\" \n   - Translation: \"The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet.\"\n5. The question asks: \"Welche Geiseln wurden dem Abschnitt zufolge nicht frühzeitig freigelassen?\" \n   - Translation: \"According to the passage, which hostages were not released early?\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Die Touristen (The tourists)\n2. Die Älteren (The elderly)\n3. Die Fotografen (The photographers)\n4. Die Kinder (The children)\n\nFrom the passage, the children, the elderly, and the photographers were released early. The only group not specifically mentioned as being released early are \"the tourists\" in general (since the hostages were tourists, but only some—children, elderly—were released early).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes events in June 1956, when Khrushchev's promises were tested by unrest in Poland. Workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, and the protest became a general protest against communism.\n2. Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order. This means he used military force.\n3. He also conceded to some economic demands. This means he accepted or recognized some of the workers' economic requests.\n4. He agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister.\n\nNow, let's look at the options and see which one was NOT part of Khrushchev's response:\n\n1. Appointment of a new Prime Minister – This DID happen (Gomulka).\n2. Use of tanks to restore order – This DID happen.\n3. Further wage cuts – The passage says workers were protesting wage cuts, but it does NOT say Khrushchev responded with more wage cuts. In fact, he conceded to some demands, which suggests the opposite.\n4. Recognizing some of the economic demands – This DID happen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that was NOT part of Khrushchev's response: further wage cuts.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage states that Luxembourg has a long history but has only been independent since 1839.\n2. It mentions that parts of present-day Belgium used to belong to Luxembourg, but after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s, these parts became part of Belgium.\n3. The passage also talks about Luxembourg's neutrality and its occupation by Germany during both World Wars.\n4. Finally, it mentions Luxembourg as a founding member of the organization that became the European Union in 1957.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Nach welchem Ereignis gingen Teile Luxemburgs an Belgien?\"  \nTranslation: \"After which event did parts of Luxembourg go to Belgium?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Erster Weltkrieg (First World War) – The passage says Luxembourg was occupied by Germany during the war, but does not mention territory going to Belgium after this event.\n2. Belgische Revolution (Belgian Revolution) – The passage specifically says that after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s, parts of Luxembourg became part of Belgium.\n3. Zweiter Weltkrieg (Second World War) – Again, the passage mentions occupation, not territorial transfer to Belgium.\n4. Gründung der Europäischen Union (Founding of the European Union) – The passage says Luxembourg was a founding member, but does not mention any territorial changes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, as the passage directly links the transfer of territory to Belgium to the Belgian Revolution.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the advantages of booking through a travel agency.\n2. It mentions that booking in advance gives travelers certainty about accommodation.\n3. Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, and can also book other types of accommodation.\n4. Travel agencies usually offer packages that may include breakfast, airport transfers, or combinations of flight and hotel.\n5. They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain further documents (like visas).\n6. Any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency, not the hotel.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Beschleunigte Reisedokumente\" (Accelerated travel documents): The passage mentions that the agency can hold your reservation while you obtain documents, but it does NOT say that the agency accelerates or speeds up the process of getting travel documents.\n2. \"Hotelangebote\" (Hotel offers): The passage clearly states that agencies have arrangements with hotels.\n3. \"All-inclusive-Pakete\" (All-inclusive packages): The passage mentions packages that include breakfast, transport, and combinations of flight and hotel.\n4. \"Zurückhalten einer Reservierung\" (Holding a reservation): The passage says agencies can hold your reservation if you need time.\n\nTherefore, the only option NOT mentioned as an advantage is accelerated travel documents.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\nThe passage says that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed. It states that \"Mutation sorgt für neue genetische Variationen,\" which translates to \"Mutation provides new genetic variations.\" It also says that selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations. Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools in each generation.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Welcher Prozess ist für das Hinzufügen genetischer Variation verantwortlich?\"  \nThis means: \"Which process is responsible for adding genetic variation?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Segregation – The passage says this mixes variation between pools, not adds new variation.\n2. Recombination – Also mixes variation, doesn't add new variation.\n3. Mutation – The passage explicitly says mutation provides new genetic variation.\n4. Exprimiert – This means \"expressed,\" which is not a process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the process that adds new genetic variation, which is mutation.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains \"Scaffolding\" (Gerüst) as a support mechanism in learning situations, especially when someone is dealing with something new, like a new computer program or project.\n2. Scaffolding is not a learning method itself, but a form of help or support.\n3. Scaffolding can be both virtual (like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office) and real (like a teacher).\n4. Virtual scaffolding is built into software to help with steps that the learner might not be able to do alone.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Ein Tutorial zu Beginn eines Computerspiels\" (A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game): This is a virtual support built into the software to help the player learn the game, matching the description of scaffolding.\n2. \"Ein SAT-Tutor\" (An SAT tutor): This is a real person providing support and guidance, which fits the description of a real-life scaffolding.\n3. \"Ein unabhängiges Lernprogramm\" (An independent learning program): This is a program that likely allows the learner to learn on their own, without built-in support or guidance. The key word is \"unabhängig\" (independent), suggesting it does not provide scaffolding.\n4. \"Der Trainer einer kleinen Liga\" (A little league coach): This is a real person providing support and guidance, fitting the description of scaffolding.\n\nTherefore, the only option that does NOT fit the definition of scaffolding as described in the passage is option 3, the independent learning program, because it implies learning without support.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses a PBS show that won more than two dozen Emmy awards and ran for a long time, though not as long as Sesame Street and Mister Roger's Neighborhood.\n2. The show focused on exploring themes from books and encouraged children to read.\n3. John Grant from WNED Buffalo is quoted as saying the show taught children the love of reading.\n4. Importantly, the passage states: \"Einige Personen, darunter John Grant, sind der Ansicht, dass sowohl die Finanzierungskrise als auch ein Wandel in der Philosophie des Bildungsfernsehens zum Ende der Serie beigetragen haben.\" This translates to: \"Some people, including John Grant, believe that both the funding crisis and a change in the philosophy of educational television contributed to the end of the series.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Unzureichende Finanzierung (Insufficient funding) – This matches the \"funding crisis\" mentioned in the passage.\n2. Zu wenig Emmy-Preise (Too few Emmy awards) – The passage says the show won more than two dozen, so this is not correct.\n3. Die Meinung von John Grant (The opinion of John Grant) – While John Grant is quoted, his opinion alone is not cited as the reason for the show's end.\n4. Der Erfolg von Mister Roger‘s Neighborhood (The success of Mister Roger's Neighborhood) – The passage does not suggest this as a reason.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\nThe passage says: \"Gute Ernährung allein garantiert keine Topleistungen, aber sie verbessert das allgemeine Wohlbefinden der jungen Athleten signifikant.\"  \nTranslation: \"Good nutrition alone does not guarantee top performances, but it significantly improves the general well-being of young athletes.\"\n\nIt also says: \"Das Beibehalten eines gesunden Energiegleichgewichts, effektive Trinkgewohnheiten und das Verständnis der verschiedenen Aspekte der Einnahme von Ergänzungspräparaten können Athleten helfen, ihre Leistung zu verbessern und ihre Freude am Sport zu steigern.\"  \nTranslation: \"Maintaining a healthy energy balance, effective drinking habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplement intake can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sport.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the question:  \n\"Welcher der folgenden Punkte kann bei einem Sportler nicht allein durch die Ernährung erreicht werden?\"  \nTranslation: \"Which of the following points cannot be achieved in an athlete by nutrition alone?\"\n\nOptions:\n1. Improved performance\n2. Increased enjoyment of sport\n3. Top performance\n4. General well-being\n\nFrom the passage, it is clear that:\n- Nutrition alone does NOT guarantee top performance (\"Topleistungen\").\n- Nutrition DOES significantly improve general well-being.\n- Nutrition, along with other factors (energy balance, hydration, supplements), can help improve performance and enjoyment, but not by nutrition alone.\n\nSo, the only thing that cannot be achieved by nutrition alone is \"Spitzenleistung\" (top performance), as explicitly stated in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "First, let's analyze the passage. The passage describes the Mumbai attacks on November 26, 2008. It mentions that the attackers brought grenades and automatic weapons and targeted several places, including a train station and a hotel. Importantly, the passage states: \"Die Angreifer von Mumbai kamen am 26. November 2008 mit Hilfe von Booten...\" which translates to \"The attackers of Mumbai came on November 26, 2008 with the help of boats...\"\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Mit welchem Transportmittel kam die militante Gruppe nach Mumbai?\" This means \"With which means of transport did the militant group come to Mumbai?\"\n\nThe options are:\n1. Eisenbahn (train)\n2. Flugzeug (airplane)\n3. Boot (boat)\n4. Auto (car)\n\nFrom the passage, it is clear that the attackers came \"mit Hilfe von Booten\" (\"with the help of boats\"). Therefore, the correct answer is \"Boot\" (boat).\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a situation in Bishkek where there were extensive lootings throughout the night, and the police were not present on the streets.\n2. It mentions that, according to an observer, Bishkek was falling into a state of \"anarchy\" as bands of people roamed the streets and looted stores.\n3. The key sentence for the question is: \"Mehrere Einwohner von Bishkek gaben den Demonstranten aus dem Süden die Schuld an der Gesetzlosigkeit.\"\n4. Translating this sentence: \"Several residents of Bishkek blamed the demonstrators from the south for the lawlessness.\"\n5. The question asks: \"Who blamed the demonstrators from the south for the lootings?\"\n6. The correct answer is the group that blamed the demonstrators from the south, which, according to the passage, is \"Einwohner von Bischkek\" (residents of Bishkek).\n\nOption 1 matches this.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage talks about a French opera by Camille Saint-Saens.\n- The story is about an artist whose life is influenced by love, drugs, and Japan.\n- It specifically says: \"Deshalb rauchen die Darsteller auf der Bühne Cannabisjoints und das Theater selbst ermutigt das Publikum zum Mitmachen.\"\n- Translation: \"Therefore, the actors on stage smoke cannabis joints and the theater itself encourages the audience to join in.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Wer raucht als erstes Joints während der Oper?\" (\"Who smokes joints first during the opera?\")\n\nOptions:\n1. Der Künstler (The artist)\n2. Das französische Publikum (The French audience)\n3. Die Darsteller (The actors/performers)\n4. Camille Saint-Saens\n\nFrom the passage, it is clear that the actors on stage are the ones who start smoking joints, and then the audience is encouraged to join. The artist is a character in the story, not necessarily the first to smoke. Camille Saint-Saens is the composer, not a participant in the opera performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains that children develop racial awareness and stereotypes early, and these stereotypes influence their behavior.\n2. It gives an example: children who identify with an ethnic minority that is stereotyped as performing poorly in school tend to perform poorly once they become aware of the stereotype.\n3. The key idea is that children may internalize stereotypes about their group and then behave in ways that align with those stereotypes.\n4. The question asks what might happen to a child who identifies with a racial minority that is stereotyped as exhibiting threatening behavior.\n5. Applying the logic from the passage, the child may internalize the stereotype about their group (i.e., being threatening) and then behave in a way that matches the stereotype.\n6. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: The child will try to avoid threatening behavior. This is the opposite of what the passage suggests.\n   - Option 2: The child will be more likely to exhibit threatening behavior. This matches the pattern described in the passage.\n   - Option 3: The child will withdraw from social situations. The passage does not mention withdrawal as a consequence.\n   - Option 4: The child refuses to interact with other racial minorities. The passage does not mention this behavior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions several politicians and their actions after the results of a primary election.\n2. It says: \"Nachdem die Ergebnisse vorlagen, lobte Gingrich Santorum, fand aber harte Worte für Romney, in dessen Namen in Iowa negative Kampagnenwerbung gegen Gingrich ausgestrahlt worden war.\"\n   - Translation: \"After the results were in, Gingrich praised Santorum, but had harsh words for Romney, in whose name negative campaign ads against Gingrich had been aired in Iowa.\"\n3. The question asks: \"Wer hat dem Abschnitt nach einen anderen Kandidaten nach Vorliegen der Ergebnisse der Vorwahl gelobt?\" \n   - Translation: \"According to the passage, who praised another candidate after the results of the primary were in?\"\n4. From the passage, it is clear that Gingrich praised Santorum after the results.\n5. Let's check the options:\n   1. Bachmann – No mention of her praising anyone.\n   2. Gingrich – Yes, he praised Santorum.\n   3. Romney – No mention of him praising anyone.\n   4. Perry – No mention of him praising anyone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the traditional path for a British heir to the throne after finishing school.\n2. It states: \"Traditionell ging der Thronerbe nach dem Ende der Schulzeit direkt zum Militär.\" This means: \"Traditionally, the heir to the throne went directly to the military after finishing school.\"\n3. It then contrasts this with Charles, who instead went to university (studied anthropology, archaeology, and history at Cambridge) and was the first royal family member to receive a university degree.\n4. The question asks: \"According to the passage, what is typical for an heir to the throne?\"\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Hochschulabschluss mit 2:2\" (A university degree with a 2:2) – The passage says Charles was the first to get a university degree, so this is not typical.\n   - Option 2: \"Statt auf die Universität zum Militär zu gehen\" (Instead of going to university, going to the military) – This matches the passage's statement about tradition.\n   - Option 3: \"Geschichte zu studieren\" (To study history) – The passage says Charles did this, but it was not typical; it was exceptional.\n   - Option 4: \"Erst auf die Universität, dann zum Militär zu gehen\" (First to university, then to the military) – The passage says this was not the tradition.\n\nThe correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says: \"Die Algenblüte wird von einer höher als gewöhnlichen Konzentration von Karenia brevis verursacht, einem natürlich auftretenden Meereseinzeller.\"\n   - Translation: The algal bloom is caused by a higher than usual concentration of Karenia brevis, a naturally occurring marine unicellular organism.\n   - This tells us Karenia brevis is a unicellular (single-celled) organism, not multicellular.\n\n2. The passage also says: \"Die Algen produzieren ein Nervengift, das Nerven sowohl beim Menschen als auch bei Fischen deaktivieren kann.\"\n   - Translation: The algae produce a neurotoxin that can deactivate nerves in both humans and fish.\n   - So, Karenia brevis can deactivate nerves in humans.\n\n3. \"Fische sterben oft aufgrund der hohen Konzentrationen des Giftes in den Gewässern.\"\n   - Fish often die due to the high concentration of the toxin in the water.\n\n4. \"Menschen können durch das Einatmen von betroffenem Wasser beeinträchtigt werden, das durch Wind und Wellen in die Luft gerät.\"\n   - Humans can be affected by inhaling contaminated water that gets into the air through wind and waves.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Ist eine Algenart (Is a type of algae) — The passage refers to Karenia brevis as an alga.\n2. Kann die Nerven beim Menschen deaktivieren (Can deactivate nerves in humans) — The passage says this is true.\n3. Ist ein Mehrzeller (Is multicellular) — The passage says it is a \"Meereseinzeller\" (marine unicellular organism), so this is NOT true.\n4. Tritt natürlich auf (Occurs naturally) — The passage says it is \"natürlich auftretend\" (naturally occurring).\n\nThe only statement that is NOT a property of Karenia brevis according to the passage is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses estimates of how many people speak Hindi and notes that it is among the most spoken languages in the world.\n2. It specifically mentions that the number of native speakers (\"Muttersprachler\") varies depending on whether closely related dialects are included in the count.\n3. The passage gives a range for the number of speakers and also mentions that up to 800 million people understand the language, but this is separate from the number of native speakers.\n4. It also notes the similarity between Hindi and Urdu, but does not say that Urdu speakers are counted as Hindi native speakers.\n5. There is no mention in the passage of counting people who can read the language as a factor in the fluctuation of native speaker numbers.\n\nNow, let's match the options:\n1. Whether closely related dialects are included – this matches exactly what the passage says.\n2. Whether Urdu speakers are included – not mentioned as a factor for native speakers.\n3. Whether people who understand the language are included – the passage distinguishes between understanding and being a native speaker.\n4. Whether people who can read the language are included – not mentioned.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the new Nintendo Revolution console's controller, which is similar to a TV remote and uses two sensors placed near the user's TV.\n2. These sensors triangulate the position of the controller in three-dimensional space.\n3. The key point is that this setup allows players to control actions and movements in video games by moving the device (the controller) in the air.\n4. The question asks what a player must do to control movements in video games.\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Ensuring the sensors are near the console is necessary for setup, but not what the player does to control movements.\n   - Option 2: Triangulating the position is done by the system, not the player.\n   - Option 3: Placing sensors near the TV is also part of setup, not the player's action during gameplay.\n   - Option 4: Moving the controller in the air is exactly what the passage says the player does to control movements in the game.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4"

      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage states that Beijing (Pékin) will host the Winter Olympics in 2022 and will be the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Games.\n2. It specifically says that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies (\"les cérémonies d'ouverture et de clôture\") as well as the indoor ice events (\"les épreuves sur glace en salle\").\n3. It then mentions that other ski events (\"d'autres épreuves de ski\") will take place at the ski resort of Taizicheng in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km from Beijing.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"D’après l’extrait, quel événement n’aura pas lieu à Pékin en 2022 ?\"  \nTranslation: According to the passage, which event will not take place in Beijing in 2022?\n\nOptions:\n1. Opening ceremonies (which the passage says will be in Beijing)\n2. Events at the Taizicheng ski resort (which the passage says will be in Taizicheng, not Beijing)\n3. Closing ceremonies (which the passage says will be in Beijing)\n4. Indoor ice events (which the passage says will be in Beijing)\n\nSo, the only event that will NOT take place in Beijing is the ski events at Taizicheng.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses both virtual and conventional teams, focusing on their similarities and differences.\n2. It states: \"Les équipes virtuelles sont soumises aux mêmes standards d'excellence que les équipes conventionnelles, mais il existe de subtiles différences.\" This means virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.\n3. The passage then describes how virtual team members often have more autonomy, due to time zone differences, and that their local management may not understand this. This suggests a difference, not a similarity.\n4. The passage introduces the concept of the \"invisible team\" (équipe invisible), which is unique to virtual teams, not conventional ones.\n5. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Both are subject to the same performance expectations. This matches the passage: \"soumis aux mêmes standards d'excellence.\"\n   - Option 2: Both have variable autonomy. The passage says virtual teams often have more autonomy, implying a difference, not a similarity.\n   - Option 3: Both report to an invisible management team. The passage says the \"équipe invisible\" is unique to virtual teams.\n   - Option 4: Both operate in the same time zone. The passage says virtual teams may operate in different time zones, which is a difference.\n\nTherefore, the only correct similarity according to the passage is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage talks about the traditional medieval castle and how it stimulates the imagination, evoking images of jousts, banquets, and Arthurian chivalry.\n2. It mentions that even among ancient ruins, it's easy to recall the sounds and smells of distant battles, almost hear the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, and feel the fear rising from the dungeon pits.\n3. Then, it questions whether our imagination is based on reality and asks why castles were built and how they were designed and constructed.\n\nNow, let's look at the options and see which are mentioned in the passage:\n\n1. \"Les fosses des donjons\" (the pits of the dungeon): The passage says \"la peur monter des fosses du donjon\" (the fear rising from the dungeon pits), so this is mentioned.\n2. \"Les joutes\" (jousts): The passage says \"évoquant des images de joutes\" (evoking images of jousts), so this is mentioned.\n3. \"La chevalerie\" (chivalry): The passage says \"chevalerie arthurienne\" (Arthurian chivalry), so this is mentioned.\n4. \"Les chevaliers\" (knights): The passage does NOT mention \"chevaliers\" (knights) directly. It mentions \"chevalerie\" (chivalry), which is the concept or code, but not the actual knights themselves.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses Indonesian cuisine, specifically focusing on Javanese cuisine.\n2. It mentions that Javanese cuisine is now widely available and is characterized by simply seasoned dishes.\n3. The passage lists the predominant flavors and ingredients favored by the Javanese: peanuts, chilies, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.\n4. The question asks which of the following sugars is mainly used in Javanese cuisine.\n5. The options are: white sugar, powdered sugar, coconut sugar, and brown sugar.\n6. The passage explicitly states \"le sucre (en particulier le sucre de coco javanais)\" which translates to \"sugar (in particular Javanese coconut sugar).\"\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is coconut sugar.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a situation where passengers were waiting in 32°C heat and were given water bottles.\n2. It mentions that Captain Scott Kouns made a statement: \"It was a hot day in Santa Clara County with temperatures exceeding 90°F. Every minute spent trapped on a roller coaster must be at least unpleasant, and it took at least an hour to extract the first person from the ride.\"\n3. The question asks: Who made a remark about the unpleasant level of heat?\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: The ride operator is not mentioned as making any remark.\n   - Option 2: The fire captain (Capitaine des pompiers) is Scott Kouns, who is quoted in the passage making the remark about the heat and the unpleasantness.\n   - Option 3: The passengers are not quoted as making any remark.\n   - Option 4: The police captain is not mentioned at all.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the fire captain.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains that stellar bodies (corps stellaires) emit light and heat because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms fuse (or condense) to create heavier elements.\n2. It also mentions that scientists are trying to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way, but this is a difficult problem.\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, what does fusion allow stellar bodies to do?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"To form heavier elements\" — The passage says fusion creates heavier elements from hydrogen atoms.\n   - Option 2: \"To build fusion reactors\" — The passage says scientists are trying to do this, not stellar bodies.\n   - Option 3: \"To emit light and heat\" — The passage says stellar bodies emit light and heat because of the energy from fusion.\n   - Option 4: \"To create hydrogen atoms\" — The passage says hydrogen atoms fuse, not that fusion creates hydrogen atoms.\n\n5. Both options 1 and 3 are supported by the passage: fusion allows stellar bodies to form heavier elements (option 1) and to emit light and heat (option 3).\n6. However, the question asks what fusion allows stellar bodies to do, and the passage directly links the emission of light and heat to the energy from fusion. The formation of heavier elements is a result of fusion, but the main effect described is the emission of light and heat.\n7. The most direct answer, based on the passage's focus, is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the tradition for the heir to the throne to do military service after finishing studies.\n2. It then says Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology, archaeology, and later history, obtaining a 2:2 degree.\n3. The key sentence is: \"Charles fut le premier membre de la famille royale britannique à obtenir une licence.\" This means \"Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a degree.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Intégrer l’armée avant d’avoir terminé ses études\" – To join the army before finishing studies. The passage says the tradition was to do military service after studies, and does not say Charles did it before.\n2. \"Étudier l’archéologie\" – To study archaeology. The passage says he studied archaeology, but does not say he was the first to do so.\n3. \"Obtenir une licence\" – To obtain a degree. The passage explicitly says he was the first royal family member to do this.\n4. \"Aller au Trinity College\" – To go to Trinity College. The passage does not say he was the first to go there.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage and the options step by step:\n\n**Passage summary:**  \n- Project-based pedagogy makes learning easier and more interesting.\n- \"Soutien\" (support) goes further: it's not a learning method, but a way to help learners when they encounter something new (like a new program or project).\n- Support can be virtual (like the Microsoft Office paperclip) or real (like a teacher).\n- Virtual scaffolds are built into software to guide, question, and explain procedures that might be too hard for the student alone.\n\n**Question:**  \nWhich of the following is NOT an example of \"soutien\" (support), according to the passage?\n\n**Options analysis:**\n1. \"Le tutoriel au début d’un jeu vidéo\" (A tutorial at the start of a video game)  \n   - This is a virtual scaffold, guiding the user through something new. The passage says this is support.\n\n2. \"Un tuteur pour préparer l’examen SAT\" (A tutor to prepare for the SAT exam)  \n   - This is a real person helping a learner with something new or difficult. The passage says a teacher is support, so a tutor is too.\n\n3. \"Un programme de recherche indépendant\" (An independent research program)  \n   - This is a program where the learner works independently, not being guided or helped. This is not support; it's self-directed learning.\n\n4. \"Un coach sportif local\" (A local sports coach)  \n   - This is a real person helping someone learn or improve at a sport. The passage says a teacher is support, so a coach is too.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOption 3 is the only one that is NOT an example of \"soutien\" as described in the passage.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains what a \"réseau d’échange d’hospitalité\" (hospitality exchange network) is. It says that such an organization connects travelers with residents of the cities they are going to visit.\n2. To join such a network, one usually fills out an online form, and sometimes additional verification is required.\n3. After joining, a list of available hosts is provided, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers.\n4. The example of Couchsurfing is given: the founder found a cheap flight to Iceland but had no place to stay, so he contacted local students and received many offers of free accommodation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. \"Des hébergements chez les locaux\" = Accommodation with locals. This matches the passage, which is about connecting travelers with local residents who can host them.\n2. \"Des vols bon marché\" = Cheap flights. The passage mentions a cheap flight as part of the founder's story, but the network itself does not offer cheap flights.\n3. \"Des visites effectuées par les guides locaux\" = Tours by local guides. The passage does not mention tours or guides.\n4. \"La mise en relation avec les autres voyageurs visitant la même destination\" = Connecting with other travelers visiting the same destination. The passage is about connecting with local residents, not other travelers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes two main types of tourism: \"tourisme récréatif\" (recreational tourism) and \"tourisme culturel\" (cultural tourism).\n2. \"Tourisme récréatif\" is when people travel to relax and have fun, often visiting beaches, theme parks, or campgrounds.\n3. \"Tourisme culturel\" is when the goal of visiting a place is to learn about its history and culture.\n4. The question asks about visiting a museum. Museums are typically places where people learn about history, art, or culture.\n5. According to the passage, if the purpose of the visit is to learn about history and culture, it is considered \"tourisme culturel.\"\n6. The options are:\n   1. Professional tourism\n   2. Recreational tourism\n   3. Cultural tourism\n   4. Outdoor tourism\n7. The correct match for visiting a museum, based on the passage, is \"tourisme culturel\" (cultural tourism).\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses \"le choc de réinsertion\" (re-entry shock), which happens when someone returns to their home country after living abroad.\n2. It says that re-entry shock happens sooner than culture shock, lasts longer, and can be more severe.\n3. Importantly, it states: \"Les voyageurs qui ont eu du mal à s'adapter à la nouvelle culture ont parfois beaucoup de mal à se réadapter à leur culture d'origine.\" This means: \"Travelers who had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes have a lot of trouble readapting to their original culture.\"\n4. The passage also mentions that when you return home, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.\n5. It notes that people at home may not be as patient or understanding as people were when you first went abroad.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Travelers who experienced a particularly difficult culture shock.\n2. Travelers who quickly adapted to life abroad.\n3. Travelers still in the honeymoon phase.\n4. Travelers who have little patience.\n\nOption 1 matches the passage: it says those who had trouble adapting to the new culture (i.e., had a difficult culture shock) may have more trouble readapting at home.\n\nOption 2 is the opposite: the passage does not say that those who adapted quickly have more trouble.\n\nOption 3 is not supported: the passage says the honeymoon phase is shorter for re-entry shock, but doesn't say those still in it have more trouble.\n\nOption 4 is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that throwing a boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.\n2. It mentions that if you want to learn to throw a boomerang that comes back to your hand, you must make sure you have a boomerang designed to return.\n3. It states that, in reality, most boomerangs available in Australia do not return.\n4. It also advises beginners not to throw in the wind.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Il revient toujours dans la main s’il est lancé correctement\" — \"It always comes back to the hand if thrown correctly.\"  \n   - The passage does not say this. It says you need a boomerang designed to return, and most do not return. So, this is incorrect.\n\n2. \"Il est plus populaire parmi les locaux que parmi les touristes\" — \"It is more popular among locals than tourists.\"  \n   - The passage says it is popular among tourists, but does not compare with locals. So, this is not supported.\n\n3. \"Peu de boomerangs sont disponibles en Australie\" — \"Few boomerangs are available in Australia.\"  \n   - The passage says most boomerangs available do not return, not that there are few boomerangs. So, this is incorrect.\n\n4. \"Seuls certains boomerangs peuvent revenir\" — \"Only certain boomerangs can return.\"  \n   - The passage explicitly says you need a boomerang designed to return, and most do not return. This matches the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a rugby match where South Africa (the Springboks) beat the All Blacks (New Zealand) at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa.\n2. The match ended 21-20, breaking the All Blacks' 15-game winning streak and ending a five-game losing streak for the Springboks.\n3. It was the last match for the All Blacks in the tournament, and they had already won the trophy two weeks earlier.\n4. The passage then says: \"Le dernier match du championnat aura lieu à l’Ellis Park de Johannesburg la semaine prochaine, lorsque les Springboks affronteront l’Australie.\" This translates to: \"The last match of the championship will take place at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks will face Australia.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Les All Blacks et l’Australie (The All Blacks and Australia) – Incorrect, as the All Blacks have already played their last match.\n2. La Nouvelle-Zélande et l’Afrique du Sud (New Zealand and South Africa) – Incorrect, as they just played, and the next match is not between them.\n3. L’Afrique du Sud et l’Australie (South Africa and Australia) – Correct, as the passage says the Springboks (South Africa) will face Australia at Ellis Park.\n4. Les Springboks et les All Blacks (The Springboks and the All Blacks) – Incorrect, as they just played, and the next match is not between them.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains the symbols for \"pousser\" (push) and \"tirer\" (pull) in the context of bowing (likely for a string instrument).\n2. The \"pousser\" (push) symbol looks like a V, and the \"tirer\" (pull) symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.\n3. \"Le haut signifie que vous devez commencer par la pointe et pousser l’archet\" — the top (V) means you start at the tip and push the bow.\n4. \"Le bas signifie que vous devez commencer par la hausse... et tirer l’archet\" — the bottom (staple) means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.\n5. \"Un archet vers le haut produit généralement un son plus doux, tandis qu'un archet vers le bas est plus fort et plus affirmé.\" — An up-bow (pousser) generally produces a softer sound, while a down-bow (tirer) is stronger and more assertive.\n\nNow, let's look at the options and see which is NOT associated with \"tirer l’archet\" (pulling the bow):\n\n1. Un son plus doux — A softer sound. According to the passage, this is associated with \"pousser\" (push/up-bow), not \"tirer\" (pull/down-bow).\n2. Un symbole qui ressemble à une agrafe — A symbol that looks like a staple. The passage says this is the symbol for \"tirer\".\n3. Un son plus fort — A stronger sound. The passage says \"tirer\" produces a stronger sound.\n4. Le fait de commencer par la hausse — Starting at the frog. The passage says \"tirer\" starts at the frog.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that is NOT associated with \"tirer l’archet\", which is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that Martelly inaugurated a new provisional electoral council (CEP) composed of nine members. This is the fifth CEP under Martelly in four years.\n2. It then says: \"Le mois dernier, une commission présidentielle a recommandé la dissolution du précédent CEP dans le cadre d’un ensemble de mesures visant à engager le pays sur la voie de nouvelles élections.\"  \n   Translation: \"Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a set of measures aimed at putting the country on the path to new elections.\"\n3. The passage continues: \"Cette commission a été la réponse de Martelly aux vastes protestations contre le régime qui ont commencé en octobre.\"  \n   Translation: \"This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.\"\n4. The protests were triggered by the absence of elections.\n\nNow, the question is: \"Who suggested the resignation of the previous provisional electoral council?\"\n\nLet's look at the options:\n1. Martelly – The passage says Martelly responded to protests by creating a commission, but it was the commission that made the recommendation.\n2. Protesters – The protesters triggered the process, but they did not directly recommend the dissolution.\n3. The presidential commission – The passage explicitly says the commission recommended the dissolution.\n4. The members of the CEP themselves – There is no mention of this in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes several measures taken by the Indian government to combat a seasonal disease transmitted from pigs to humans by mosquitoes.\n2. The measures mentioned are: deployment of pig collectors in severely affected areas, distribution of thousands of mosquito nets, spraying of pesticides, and the promise of several million vials of encephalitis vaccine.\n3. The passage specifically states: \"Les plans de livraison de vaccins dans les zones historiquement les plus touchées cette année ont été retardés en raison du manque de fonds et de la faible priorité accordée à ces maladies par rapport à d’autres.\" This means that the delivery plans for vaccines in the most affected areas have been delayed due to lack of funds and low priority.\n4. The other measures (pig collectors, mosquito nets, pesticides) are described as already being implemented or distributed.\n5. Therefore, the last measure to be put in place, according to the passage, will be the vaccination campaign, since its implementation has been delayed.\n\nAnswer:\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that good nutritional practices alone are not enough to guarantee elite performance, but they can have a significant impact on the general well-being of young athletes.\n2. It mentions that maintaining a good energy balance, adequate and regular hydration, and good knowledge about nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy their sport more.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"De bonnes pratiques nutritionnelles\" (Good nutritional practices): The passage directly mentions this as beneficial.\n2. \"Des performances d’élite régulières\" (Regular elite performances): The passage specifically says that good nutrition alone does NOT guarantee elite performance. It does not suggest that regular elite performances are a way to enjoy sport more; rather, it says nutrition helps with well-being and enjoyment, not necessarily elite performance.\n3. \"Une hydratation adéquate\" (Adequate hydration): The passage mentions this as important.\n4. \"Le maintien d’un bon équilibre énergétique\" (Maintaining a good energy balance): The passage mentions this as important.\n\nSo, the only option NOT suggested as a way for young athletes to enjoy their sport more is option 2, \"regular elite performances.\"\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the transition from running 400 meters to 800 meters.\n2. It states that with this transition, speed becomes much less important, and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.\n3. It acknowledges that a good middle-distance runner (someone who can break a two-minute record) should have some speed, but above all, must have well-developed endurance.\n4. It also mentions that some cross-country running in winter, combined with upper body training, is the best preparation for the racing season.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"S’entraîner à la course de type cross-country en hiver\" (Training with cross-country running in winter): This is mentioned as good preparation, but not as the most important thing.\n2. \"Cultiver l’endurance plutôt que la vitesse\" (Developing endurance rather than speed): The passage explicitly says endurance is much more important than speed for an excellent middle-distance runner.\n3. \"Battre un record de deux minutes\" (Breaking a two-minute record): This is used as an example of a good runner, not as the most important thing.\n4. \"Cultiver la vitesse plutôt que l’endurance\" (Developing speed rather than endurance): The passage says the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the difficulty for primates with a human-like digestive system to get enough amino acids (from proteins) from plant resources in the savanna.\n2. It mentions that the most accessible plant proteins are in leaves and legumes, but these are hard to digest unless cooked.\n3. In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide all vital amino acids.\n4. The passage concludes that our ancestors likely solved their \"protein problem\" similarly to savanna chimpanzees—by eating animal-based foods.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. \"Des feuilles mortes\" (dead leaves): The passage says leaves are hard to digest unless cooked, and dead leaves are even less nutritious.\n2. \"Des légumineuses crues\" (raw legumes): The passage says legumes are hard to digest unless cooked, so raw legumes are not a good solution.\n3. \"Des criquets\" (locusts): While not mentioned directly, locusts are animals/insects, similar to ants and termites, which the passage says are easy to digest and provide all vital amino acids.\n4. \"Des tiges de fleurs\" (flower stems): Not mentioned, and likely similar to leaves—plant material, hard to digest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the animal-based option, which is \"des criquets\" (locusts).\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how long-distance calls are made. It says that when you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.\n2. The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth almost instantly.\n3. The passage also mentions that satellites and telescopes are sent into space by rockets (fusées), and that telescopes are used to avoid atmospheric distortion.\n4. The question asks: Which of the following elements sends long-distance calls back to Earth?\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - 1. Les télescopes (Telescopes): The passage says telescopes are used for observing, not for relaying calls.\n   - 2. Les satellites (Satellites): The passage explicitly says satellites receive and send calls back to Earth.\n   - 3. Les lumières (Lights): The passage mentions light in the context of telescopes, not calls.\n   - 4. Les fusées (Rockets): Rockets are used to launch satellites and telescopes, not to relay calls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains that if you stood on Io, you would weigh less than on Earth. Specifically, someone who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds (16kg) on Io.\n2. The passage concludes: \"Donc la gravité, bien sûr, vous attire moins.\" (\"So gravity, of course, pulls you less.\")\n3. This means that the gravitational pull on Io is weaker than on Earth.\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"La gravité de la Terre vous attirerait moins que la gravité d’Io\" (\"Earth's gravity would pull you less than Io's gravity\") — This is incorrect, as Earth's gravity pulls you more.\n   - Option 2: \"La gravité d’Io attire plus et c’est pour cela que vous pèseriez moins\" (\"Io's gravity pulls more and that's why you would weigh less\") — This is incorrect; if Io's gravity pulled more, you would weigh more, not less.\n   - Option 3: \"La gravité d’Io attire plus et c’est pour cela que vous pèseriez plus\" (\"Io's gravity pulls more and that's why you would weigh more\") — This is also incorrect; the passage says you weigh less on Io.\n   - Option 4: \"La gravité de la Terre vous attirerait plus que la gravité d’Io\" (\"Earth's gravity would pull you more than Io's gravity\") — This matches the passage, as Earth's gravity is stronger and makes you weigh more.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes an incident involving a photographer who died after being hit by a vehicle.\n2. The photographer was transported to a hospital but died from his injuries.\n3. According to the passage, the photographer \"a arrêté son véhicule de l’autre côté du boulevard Sepulveda et a tenté de prendre des photos de l’arrêt de police avant de traverser la route et de continuer.\"\n   - Translation: \"stopped his vehicle on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and tried to take photos of the police stop before crossing the road and continuing.\"\n4. The police officer told him to go back twice.\n5. The passage does not mention the photographer trying to park, nor does it say he was trying to persuade the police officer to let him continue taking photos. It also does not specifically say he was just crossing a busy highway; rather, he was trying to take photos of the police stop.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Se garer sur le boulevard Sepulveda (Parking on Sepulveda Boulevard) – The passage says he stopped his vehicle, but the main action before being hit was not parking.\n2. Prendre des photos de l’arrêt de police (Taking photos of the police stop) – The passage explicitly says he tried to take photos of the police stop before crossing the road.\n3. Traverser une autoroute très fréquentée (Crossing a busy highway) – He did cross the road, but the main action he was trying to do was take photos.\n4. Persuader un agent de police de le laisser continuer à prendre des photos (Persuading a police officer to let him continue taking photos) – The passage does not mention him trying to persuade the officer.\n\nThe most accurate answer, based on the passage, is option 2: he was trying to take photos of the police stop before being hit.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, has issued a warning about \"extremists from Somalia\" who are planning suicide bomb attacks on Kenyan and Ethiopian soil.\n2. The US says it learned from an anonymous source that suicide bombers would be used to blow up \"important sites\" in Ethiopia and Kenya.\n3. The key details are:\n   - The attacks are planned in both Kenya and Ethiopia (so, two countries).\n   - The targets are \"important sites\" (plural), indicating multiple locations in each country or across both countries.\n   - The method is suicide bombings.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. \"Faire exploser des bombes à différents sites importants dans un seul pays\" — Blowing up bombs at different important sites in only one country. This is incorrect because the passage mentions two countries.\n2. \"Faire exploser des bombes dans deux pays\" — Blowing up bombs in two countries. This is partially correct, but it doesn't specify that the bombs are to be set off at important sites.\n3. \"Faire exploser des bombes à différents sites importants dans deux pays\" — Blowing up bombs at different important sites in two countries. This matches the passage exactly: multiple important sites, in both Kenya and Ethiopia.\n4. \"Faire exploser des bombes dans un seul pays\" — Blowing up bombs in only one country. This is incorrect.\n\nThe most accurate answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Let's analyze the passage:\n   - The passage says that the château de Kirby Muxloe is more like a fortified house than a real castle.\n   - It mentions that its glass bay windows and thin walls would not have withstood a determined assault for long.\n   - In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began its construction, the country was relatively peaceful, and defense was only needed against small bands of marauding itinerants.\n\n2. Now, let's look at each option:\n\n   - Option 1: \"Les parois épaisses du château ont été construites sur ordre de Lord Hastings\" (The thick walls of the castle were built on Lord Hastings' orders)\n     - The passage says the walls were thin, not thick. This is incorrect.\n\n   - Option 2: \"Il n’avait pas besoin de défenses importantes car le pays était paisible au moment de sa construction\" (It did not need significant defenses because the country was peaceful at the time of its construction)\n     - The passage explicitly states that the country was relatively peaceful and only small-scale defense was needed. This matches the passage.\n\n   - Option 3: \"La construction du château n’était pas typique de son époque\" (The construction of the castle was not typical of its time)\n     - The passage says it was typical of its time (\"Typique de l'époque\"). This is incorrect.\n\n   - Option 4: \"Il a été construit pour résister à des assauts acharnés et prolongés\" (It was built to withstand determined and prolonged assaults)\n     - The passage says the castle would not have withstood such assaults. This is incorrect.\n\n3. The only correct option is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Step 1: Understand the passage  \nThe passage discusses a statement by Leslie Aun, spokesperson for the Komen Foundation. The Komen Foundation has a new rule: it will not give grants or funding to organizations under judicial investigation. Because of this rule, Planned Parenthood (le Planning familial) was disqualified from receiving funding, since it is currently under investigation regarding how it spends and reports its money. This investigation is being led by Congressman Cliff Stearns, who is the chair of a subcommittee under the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is investigating whether taxpayer money is being used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the question  \nThe question asks: \"Which organization is the subject of a judicial investigation?\"\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options  \n1. The House Energy and Commerce Committee – This is the committee overseeing the investigation, not the subject.\n2. The Komen Foundation – This is the organization that made the rule, not under investigation.\n3. Planned Parenthood – The passage says this organization is under investigation.\n4. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations – This is the subcommittee conducting the investigation, not the subject.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer  \nBased on the passage, Planned Parenthood is the organization under investigation.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the diet of the triceratops, specifically mentioning its powerful teeth and beak.\n2. It says the triceratops could crush not only leaves but also hard branches and roots.\n3. The passage introduces the cycadée, a plant common in the Cretaceous, which looks like a small palm with a crown of spiky, bristly leaves.\n4. It states: \"Un tricératops aurait pu utiliser son bec puissant pour enlever les feuilles avant de manger le tronc.\" This means \"A triceratops could have used its powerful beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk.\"\n5. This suggests that, according to the passage, the triceratops would eat the trunk of the cycadée, not the leaves, roots, or fruits.\n6. The other options (leaves, roots, fruits) are either not mentioned as being eaten or are specifically said to be removed or not likely to be eaten.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage and each option step by step:\n\n**Passage summary:**\n- Goma is a tourist city in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.\n- In 2002, it was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, especially the city center.\n- Goma is reasonably safe, but any trip outside the city should be researched due to ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.\n- Goma is the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo and for affordable mountain gorilla treks.\n- Boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) are a good way to get around Goma, with a normal price of about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.\n\n**Now, let's analyze each option:**\n\n1. **\"Les combats du Nord-Kivu sont divertissants\"**  \n   Translation: \"The fighting in North Kivu is entertaining.\"  \n   - The passage warns that there is ongoing fighting in North Kivu and that visitors should research before traveling outside Goma. It does not suggest that the fighting is entertaining; in fact, it implies it is dangerous. Advising tourists that the fighting is entertaining is not wise.\n\n2. **\"C’est le lieu idéal pour pister des gorilles des montagnes à un prix abordable\"**  \n   Translation: \"It is the ideal place to track mountain gorillas at an affordable price.\"  \n   - The passage says Goma is a starting point for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa. This advice is supported by the passage.\n\n3. **\"La moto taxi est un très bon moyen de transport\"**  \n   Translation: \"Motorcycle taxi is a very good means of transport.\"  \n   - The passage says you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma and gives the local price, suggesting it is a good means of transport.\n\n4. **\"Le pied du volcan Nyiragongo est situé dans la ville\"**  \n   Translation: \"The foot of the Nyiragongo volcano is located in the city.\"  \n   - The passage says Goma is the starting point for climbing the volcano, but it does not say the volcano's foot is in the city itself. However, this is not as clearly unwise as option 1, which is about the fighting being entertaining.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe only advice that is clearly not wise and directly contradicts the passage is option 1, which treats dangerous fighting as entertainment.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses ways to travel the world cheaply, focusing on minimizing expenses rather than working while traveling.\n2. It mentions that those willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability can reduce expenses to nearly zero.\n3. The passage is about people who are ready to give up certain conveniences for the sake of saving money.\n4. The question asks who might have difficulties traveling on a very tight budget.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. \"Quelqu’un qui aime le défi\" (Someone who likes a challenge): The passage suggests that traveling on a tight budget is a challenge, so someone who likes challenges would not have difficulty; they might even enjoy it.\n2. \"Quelqu’un sans impératif de temps\" (Someone without time constraints): The passage says that you need to be willing to sacrifice time, so someone without time constraints would not have difficulty.\n3. \"Quelqu’un dont l’intention est de télétravailler pendant son voyage\" (Someone intending to telework during their trip): The passage distinguishes between working while traveling and minimizing expenses. It focuses on the latter. Someone who wants to telework is in the first category (working while traveling), not the second (minimizing expenses). However, the passage does not say that such a person would have difficulty; it just says the article is not about them.\n4. \"Quelqu’un appréciant de suivre un itinéraire\" (Someone who likes to follow an itinerary): The passage says you must be willing to sacrifice predictability. Someone who likes to follow an itinerary values predictability and may have difficulty with the unpredictability of budget travel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the person who likes to follow an itinerary, as they may struggle with the lack of predictability required for ultra-budget travel.\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France.\n2. It says these varieties are slightly different but mutually intelligible.\n3. It specifically mentions that the \"système de numérotation\" (numbering system) in Belgium and French-speaking Switzerland has some small particularities that differ from the French spoken in France.\n4. It also mentions that the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.\n5. However, it says that all Belgians and Swiss francophones would have learned standard French at school, so they can understand the standard French numbering system.\n6. The passage does NOT mention differences in spelling (\"orthographe\") between the regions.\n7. It also does NOT say that the pronunciation of ALL words is different, only \"certains mots\" (some words).\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"La prononciation de tous les mots\" — The passage says only some words have different pronunciation, not all.\n2. \"Le système de numérotation\" — The passage specifically says this is different between France and Belgium/Switzerland.\n3. \"Le français standard enseigné à l’école\" — The passage says they all learn standard French at school, so this is not different.\n4. \"L’orthographe de certains mots\" — The passage does not mention spelling differences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions that, according to the US Geological Survey, there were no earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week.\n2. The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reports no earthquakes in the Hekla region in the last 48 hours.\n3. The passage then states: \"L'important tremblement de terre ayant entraîné le changement de phase a eu lieu le 10 mars sur la face nord-est de la caldeira du sommet du volcan.\"  \n   Translation: \"The significant earthquake that led to the phase change took place on March 10 on the northeast face of the caldera at the summit of the volcano.\"\n4. The rest of the passage discusses clouds that were not related to volcanic activity and possible confusion about an eruption.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"D’après l’extrait, quand un changement de phase a-t-il eu lieu ?\"  \nTranslation: \"According to the excerpt, when did a phase change take place?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Before March 10 – The passage does not say this; it says the phase change happened on March 10.\n2. In the last 48 hours – The passage says no earthquakes in the last 48 hours.\n3. On March 10 – The passage explicitly says the earthquake that caused the phase change happened on March 10.\n4. The previous week – The passage says no earthquakes in the previous week.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\nThe passage discusses the concept of time, how it surrounds us, and how it is difficult to understand. It mentions that time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars. It also explains that we experience time as a series of events moving from the future to the past through the present. Time is a way to compare the duration of events. Importantly, the passage says: \"Vous pouvez marquer le temps qui passe vous-même en observant la répétition d'un événement cyclique. Un événement cyclique est quelque chose qui se reproduit régulièrement.\" This means: \"You can mark the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Que faudrait-il noter à propos d’un événement cyclique pour pouvoir suivre le passage du temps ?\"  \nTranslation: \"What should you note about a cyclical event in order to track the passage of time?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Sa durée (Its duration) – While duration is related to time, the passage specifically mentions observing the repetition of cyclical events to mark time, not their duration.\n2. Sa répétition (Its repetition) – The passage directly says you can mark the passage of time by observing the repetition of a cyclical event.\n3. Ce qu’il affecte (What it affects) – The passage does not mention this.\n4. Sa difficulté (Its difficulty) – The passage does not mention this.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that matches the passage's statement about observing the repetition of cyclical events.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions that the document will address the border dispute that Palestine claims based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war. This relates to border conflicts.\n2. It also mentions the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations.\n3. Another topic is the Jordan Valley, specifically Israel's demand for a permanent military presence there for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to five years.\n4. The passage does NOT mention the cause of the 1967 war; it only references the borders as they existed before that war.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. The future of Jerusalem – This is included in the document (mentioned in the passage).\n2. The cause of the 1967 war – This is NOT included in the document (not mentioned in the passage).\n3. A military presence in the valley – This is included (discussed in the passage).\n4. Border conflicts – This is included (the border dispute is mentioned).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that Martelly inaugurated a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with nine members. This is the fifth CEP under Martelly in four years.\n2. Last month, a presidential commission recommended dissolving the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country toward new elections.\n3. This commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.\n4. These protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place in 2011.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. \"La commission présidentielle était une réponse aux protestations\"  \n   - The passage says: \"Cette commission a été la réponse de Martelly aux vastes protestations...\"  \n   - This is TRUE.\n\n2. \"Le retard dans les élections a déclenché des protestations\"  \n   - The passage says: \"Ces protestations... ont été déclenchées par l’absence d’élections...\"  \n   - This is TRUE.\n\n3. \"Les protestations réclamaient la démission de l’ancien Conseil électoral provisoire\"  \n   - The passage does NOT say that the protests specifically demanded the resignation of the previous CEP. It only says the protests were against the regime and triggered by the absence of elections.\n\n4. \"Les protestations ont parfois été violentes\"  \n   - The passage says: \"Ces protestations parfois violentes...\"  \n   - This is TRUE.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true according to the passage is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage is about Jonny Reid, a co-driver for the New Zealand A1GP team, who drove over the Auckland Harbour Bridge in a race car called Black Beauty.\n2. He crossed the bridge at speeds exceeding 160 km/h seven times.\n3. The New Zealand police had difficulty using their speed radars to measure his speed because the car was very low to the ground.\n4. The only time the police managed to clock his speed was when he slowed down to 160 km/h.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"À quel moment la police a-t-elle pu utiliser ses radars pour chronométrer la vitesse de Jonny Reid ?\"  \nTranslation: \"At what moment were the police able to use their radars to clock Jonny Reid's speed?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Quand il conduisait à 160 km/h (When he was driving at 160 km/h)\n2. À son septième passage sur le pont (At his seventh crossing of the bridge)\n3. Quand il conduisait à plus de 160 km/h (When he was driving at more than 160 km/h)\n4. À son premier passage sur le pont (At his first crossing of the bridge)\n\nFrom the passage, the only time the police managed to clock his speed was when he slowed down to 160 km/h. This matches option 1.\n\nOption 2 and 4 are not mentioned in the passage as the specific time when the police clocked his speed. Option 3 is incorrect because the police could not clock his speed when he was going faster than 160 km/h.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage explains that a curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, and can include meat or vegetables. \n- It mentions that curries can be \"solid\" or \"liquid\" depending on the amount of sauce.\n- Importantly, it says: \"Dans les régions intérieures du nord de l'Inde et du Pakistan, le yaourt est couramment utilisé dans les currys ; dans le sud de l'Inde et certaines autres régions côtières du sous-continent, le lait de coco est couramment utilisé.\"\n- This means: In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.\n\nThe question asks: \"À la place de quel ingrédient le lait de coco est-il parfois utilisé dans certaines régions ?\"  \nTranslation: \"In place of which ingredient is coconut milk sometimes used in certain regions?\"\n\nFrom the passage, coconut milk is used in some regions where yogurt is used in others. So, coconut milk is sometimes used instead of yogurt.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n1. La viande (meat)\n2. Les légumes (vegetables)\n3. Le yaourt (yogurt)\n4. Les épices (spices)\n\nThe correct answer is \"le yaourt\" (yogurt).\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a region bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west. It then gives advice specifically to women travelers.\n2. The advice includes: women should say they are married regardless of their actual marital status, wear a wedding ring (not too valuable), and be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviors they consider harassment (such as being followed or grabbed by the arm).\n3. The passage explicitly says: \"Soyez ferme dans le refus des avances hommes, et n'ayez pas peur de tenir bon (différences culturelles ou non, ça ne veut pas dire que c'est acceptable !)\" which means \"Be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!).\"\n4. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Reconnaître qu'il est rare d'être suivies\" (\"Recognize that it is rare to be followed\") — This is incorrect; the passage says it is common for women to be followed.\n   - Option 2: \"Porter une grosse alliance pour mettre en évidence son état civil\" (\"Wear a big wedding ring to highlight your marital status\") — The passage says to wear a wedding ring, but not one that looks too valuable (\"qui ne doit pas sembler trop précieuse\"), so this is not correct.\n   - Option 3: \"Comprendre que les différences culturelles poussent à éviter de tenir bon\" (\"Understand that cultural differences lead you to avoid standing your ground\") — The passage says the opposite: stand your ground despite cultural differences.\n   - Option 4: \"En cas d’avances non désirées, soyez fermes lorsque vous repoussez les avances des hommes\" (\"In case of unwanted advances, be firm when you reject men's advances\") — This matches exactly what the passage recommends.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the journey of the \"Dunlap Broadsides,\" which are printed copies of a document (the Declaration of Independence).\n2. The process started with the manuscript being sent to John Dunlap's print shop after its adoption by Congress on July 4.\n3. The printed copies were made overnight (July 4-5) at Dunlap's print shop.\n4. The first public reading was at Independence Hall on July 8.\n5. One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9.\n6. A copy arrived in London on August 10.\n\nNow, let's look at the options and the order in which each location received a Dunlap Broadside:\n\n- Dunlap's print shop: This is where the copies were first made, so it is the first location.\n- Independence Hall: The first public reading was on July 8, so it received a copy before that date.\n- New York: Washington received a copy on July 6 and had it read to his troops on July 9.\n- London: A copy arrived on August 10, which is after all the other dates mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the last location among the options to receive a Dunlap Broadside is London.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the main ingredients of Majorcan (majorquine) cuisine.\n2. It states that the cuisine is based on bread (le pain), vegetables (les légumes), and meat (la viande, especially pork), and uses olive oil.\n3. It also gives an example of a simple dish, Pa amb Oli, which includes bread, olive oil, tomato, and other available condiments like cheese and tuna.\n4. Now, let's look at the options:\n   - 1. La viande (meat): Mentioned as a base ingredient.\n   - 2. Le pain (bread): Mentioned as a base ingredient.\n   - 3. Les céréales (cereals): Not mentioned as a base ingredient in the passage.\n   - 4. Les légumes (vegetables): Mentioned as a base ingredient.\n5. The only option not explicitly mentioned as a staple or base ingredient in the passage is \"les céréales\" (cereals).\n\nAnswer:\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains that avalanches are not abnormal; steep slopes can only hold a small amount of snow, and the excess falls as an avalanche.\n2. It says the problem is that snow sticks (\"la neige colle\"), so if it collapses, there must have been a trigger (\"élément déclencheur\").\n3. It then lists possible triggers: a slight collapse of snow, solar warming (\"réchauffement solaire\"), more snow (\"davantage de neige\"), natural events, or human activity.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"La neige qui colle\" (Sticky snow)\n2. \"Les humains\" (Humans)\n3. \"La lumière du soleil\" (Sunlight)\n4. \"Davantage de neige\" (More snow)\n\nFrom the passage:\n- Humans are mentioned as a possible trigger.\n- Sunlight (solar warming) is mentioned as a possible trigger.\n- More snow is mentioned as a possible trigger.\n- Sticky snow is described as a property of the snow, not as a trigger. In fact, the passage says that the snow sticks, and if it collapses, there must be a trigger. So sticky snow is not itself a trigger.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses famous Greeks, including politicians, scientists, and artists.\n2. It specifically mentions Homère (Homer), describing him as \"le poète aveugle\" which translates to \"the blind poet.\"\n3. The passage says Homer is the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey.\n4. The question asks: \"Qu’est-ce que le poète grec Homère ne pouvait pas faire ?\" which means \"What could the Greek poet Homer not do?\"\n5. The options are:\n   1. Entendre (to hear)\n   2. Voir (to see)\n   3. Marcher (to walk)\n   4. Parler (to speak)\n6. Since the passage calls Homer \"the blind poet,\" it means he could not see.\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses how certain airlines (Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines) have expanded their offerings in Africa and offer competitive prices compared to European airlines.\n2. It mentions that Turkish Airlines serves 39 destinations in 30 African countries as of 2014.\n3. The passage then gives advice: If you have more time to travel, compare the total ticket price to Africa with the price of a round-the-world ticket.\n4. Importantly, it says: \"N'oubliez pas d'ajouter les frais supplémentaires de visas, de taxes de départ, de transport terrestre, etc. pour tous ces endroits en dehors de l'Afrique.\" \n   - Translation: \"Don't forget to add the extra costs of visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Que ne faut-il pas ajouter en comparant le prix total d’un billet pour l’Afrique avec un billet pour faire le tour du monde ?\"\n- Translation: \"What should you NOT add when comparing the total price of a ticket to Africa with a round-the-world ticket?\"\n\nSo, when comparing, you should add extra costs for places outside Africa (visas, taxes, ground transport, etc.), but not for Africa itself.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n1. Les frais supplémentaires de visas pour des endroits hors Afrique  \n   - Extra visa fees for places outside Africa. The passage says you SHOULD add these.\n\n2. Le coût des taxes de départ en Afrique  \n   - Departure taxes in Africa. The passage does NOT say to add these; it says to add costs for places outside Africa.\n\n3. Le coût d’un visa pour l’Afrique  \n   - Visa cost for Africa. Again, the passage says to add costs for places outside Africa, not Africa itself.\n\n4. Le coût du transport terrestre dans des lieux en dehors de l’Afrique  \n   - Ground transport costs in places outside Africa. The passage says you SHOULD add these.\n\nSo, the correct answer is the cost that you should NOT add, which is related to Africa itself. Both options 2 and 3 are about Africa, but the passage specifically says to add costs for places outside Africa, so you should NOT add costs for Africa itself.\n\nBetween options 2 and 3, both are correct in that sense, but the best fit is option 3, as the passage mentions \"frais supplémentaires de visas\" (extra visa fees) for places outside Africa",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says: \"Nous nous efforcerons de réduire les émissions de dioxyde de carbone par unité de PIB de manière significative d'ici 2020 par rapport au niveau de 2005\", which means \"We will strive to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 2020 compared to the 2005 level.\" This gives a date (2020) and a comparison year (2005).\n\n2. It also says: \"Il n'a pas chiffré ces réductions, disant qu'elles seront basées sur la production économique chinoise.\" This means \"He did not quantify these reductions, saying they will be based on Chinese economic output.\" So, he did not give a specific number for the reductions, but he did say what they would be based on (economic output).\n\n3. Hu encouraged developing countries \"à éviter l'ancienne méthode qui consistait à polluer d'abord et à nettoyer ensuite\" (\"to avoid the old method of polluting first and cleaning up later\"). This is advice to developing countries about pollution.\n\n4. He added that developing countries should not be asked to take on obligations beyond their stage of development, responsibility, and capacity.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Sur quoi les réductions sont basées\" (\"What the reductions are based on\") — He did mention this: they are based on economic output.\n2. \"Un conseil aux pays en voie de développement en matière de pollution\" (\"Advice to developing countries about pollution\") — He did give advice.\n3. \"Une date à laquelle il espère que les émissions de carbone seront réduites\" (\"A date by which he hopes carbon emissions will be reduced\") — He mentioned 2020.\n4. \"Un objectif chiffré pour les réductions des émissions de carbone\" (\"A quantified target for carbon emission reductions\") — He specifically did NOT give a quantified target.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains the structure and function of Babylonian temples. Each god had a main temple, considered the god's home. People brought sacrifices, and priests performed ceremonies and festivals.\n2. The temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary. Only priests could access the inner sanctuary.\n3. Ziggurats were sometimes built as part of the temple, with a special sanctuary at the top for the god.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. \"Dans la cour d’un temple, en train d’apporter des sacrifices\" — The passage says people brought sacrifices, and the courtyard was open, so an average citizen could be here.\n2. \"À une cérémonie dans un temple principal\" — Ceremonies and festivals were held, and people participated, so an average citizen could be here.\n3. \"À un festival dans la cour d’un temple\" — Festivals were held, and the courtyard was open, so an average citizen could be here.\n4. \"Dans un sanctuaire intérieur, en train d’apporter des sacrifices\" — The passage specifically says only priests could access the inner sanctuary, so an average citizen could NOT be here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains what happens after an electric bulb has been used for hundreds of hours: \"le filament dans l'ampoule finit par brûler et l'ampoule électrique ne marche plus.\" This means \"the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the electric bulb no longer works.\"\n2. The passage then discusses the need to replace the bulb and the precautions to take, such as turning off the switch or unplugging the device, to avoid electric shocks.\n3. The question asks: \"According to the passage, what eventually prevents an electric bulb from working?\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. The lighting device not being turned off properly – The passage mentions this as a safety concern, not as a reason the bulb stops working.\n2. The metallic base of the bulb being only partially inserted into the socket – This is mentioned as a safety risk, not as the cause of the bulb failing.\n3. The filament in the bulb having burned out – This is directly stated in the passage as the reason the bulb stops working.\n4. The slowing down of the electric current in the socket – The passage does not mention this at all.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the dress code for visiting a monastery.\n2. Women must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders covered. If they don't have appropriate clothing, most monasteries provide \"étoles\" (shawls or stoles) for women who arrive without anything.\n3. It is also mentioned that men must wear pants covering their knees. If they don't have such pants, they can borrow them from the stock at the entrance.\n4. The passage specifically mentions that skirts (for women) and pants (for men) can be borrowed at the entrance.\n5. It also says that \"étoles\" are provided for women who need to cover their shoulders.\n6. However, there is no mention of \"shorts\" being provided or allowed. In fact, the dress code requires covering the knees, so shorts would not be appropriate.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Une jupe (a skirt) – can be borrowed.\n2. Un short (shorts) – not mentioned as being available, and not appropriate for the dress code.\n3. Un pantalon (pants) – can be borrowed.\n4. Une étole (a stole/shawl) – can be borrowed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the item that is not likely to be borrowed in a monastery: \"un short\".\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a rugby tournament that started at 10 am, with South Africa (Afrique du Sud) as the top-ranked team.\n2. South Africa started well, winning 26-0 against Zambia.\n3. However, it is mentioned that South Africa \"semblait décidément rouillée lors de son match contre ses consœurs du sud\" (seemed decidedly rusty during their match against their southern sisters), but \"s'est cependant graduellement améliorée au fil du tournoi\" (however, gradually improved as the tournament went on).\n4. The passage then describes their disciplined defense, ball control, and teamwork, which made them stand out.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"D’après l’extrait, à partir de quand le jeu de l’Afrique du Sud a-t-il commencé à s’améliorer ?\" (\"According to the excerpt, from when did South Africa's play start to improve?\")\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. \"Vers 10:00 am\" (Around 10:00 am) — The passage says the matches started at 10 am, but it does not say their play improved at that time.\n2. \"Après avoir resserré sa défense\" (After tightening their defense) — The passage mentions their good defense, but not that improvement started after this.\n3. \"Après avoir perdu face à la Zambie\" (After losing to Zambia) — The passage says they beat Zambia 26-0, so this is incorrect.\n4. \"Au fur et à mesure que le tournoi avançait\" (As the tournament went on) — The passage explicitly says \"s'est cependant graduellement améliorée au fil du tournoi\" (gradually improved as the tournament went on).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 4.\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses two reservoirs (pools) of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.\n2. It states that \"mutation adds new genetic variation,\" while \"selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.\"\n3. It also mentions that \"segregation and recombination alternate variations between the two pools each generation.\"\n4. The question asks: \"What process is responsible for adding genetic variation?\"\n5. From the passage, the process that adds new genetic variation is explicitly stated to be \"mutation.\"\n6. The other options (segregation, recombination, exprimée) are either involved in shuffling or expressing existing variation, not adding new variation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n- The passage says Bobek was born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.\n- He became known by playing for Partizan Belgrade.\n- He joined Partizan in 1945 and stayed until 1958.\n- During his time at the club, he scored 403 goals in 468 matches.\n- No other player has made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.\n- In 1995, he was elected the best player in the history of Partizan.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. \"Il a commencé à jouer pour le Partizan en 1945\"  \n   Translation: He started playing for Partizan in 1945.  \n   The passage says he joined Partizan in 1945. This matches the information.\n\n2. \"Il a joué pour Zagreb avant de jouer pour le Partizan Belgrade\"  \n   Translation: He played for Zagreb before playing for Partizan Belgrade.  \n   The passage only says he was born in Zagreb, not that he played for a team there.\n\n3. \"Il a joué pour le Partizan jusqu’en 1995\"  \n   Translation: He played for Partizan until 1995.  \n   The passage says he stayed until 1958, not 1995.\n\n4. \"Il est devenu célèbre après avoir été élu meilleur joueur du Partizan\"  \n   Translation: He became famous after being elected the best player of Partizan.  \n   The passage says he became known by playing for Partizan, and he was elected best player in 1995, long after his playing career.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how children become aware of race and racial stereotypes early on, and that these stereotypes affect their behavior.\n2. It gives an example: children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotyped as underperforming in school tend to fail in school once they become aware of that stereotype.\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, the fact that a child knows about racial stereotypes could have an effect on which of the following?\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. \"The racial minority with which they decide to identify\" – The passage does not mention children choosing which minority to identify with; it assumes identification is already present.\n2. \"Their behavior\" – The passage explicitly says that stereotypes have an effect on behavior, giving the example of school performance.\n3. \"Their relationships with other children\" – The passage does not discuss relationships with other children.\n4. \"Their definition of race\" – The passage does not discuss how children define race.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that matches the passage: \"their behavior.\"\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that this is the largest acquisition in eBay's history.\n2. It mentions that the company hopes to \"diversify its sources of revenue\" and \"gain popularity in regions where Skype is strong, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\"\n3. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Consolider ses revenus\" (Consolidate its revenues) – The passage talks about diversifying, not consolidating.\n   - Option 2: \"Se développer sur de nouveaux territoires\" (Expand into new territories) – The passage mentions gaining popularity in new regions, which aligns with this option.\n   - Option 3: \"Augmenter son profil\" (Increase its profile) – While gaining popularity could be related, the passage is more specific about regions.\n   - Option 4: \"Satisfaire ses actionnaires\" (Satisfy its shareholders) – The passage does not mention shareholders.\n\nThe best match is option 2, as the passage specifically mentions eBay's hope to gain popularity in new regions.\n\n2"

      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the number of people who speak Hindi and mentions that there are different estimates.\n2. It says that Hindi is between the second and fourth most common language in the world.\n3. The key sentence is: \"Количество носителей языка разнится в зависимости от того, берутся ли в учет очень близкие диалекты.\" This translates to: \"The number of native speakers varies depending on whether very closely related dialects are taken into account.\"\n4. The passage also mentions the number of people who understand the language and the similarity between Hindi and Urdu, but the specific reason for the variation in the number of speakers is whether closely related dialects are included.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Whether very closely related dialects to Hindi are taken into account\n2. Whether people who speak Urdu are taken into account\n3. Whether people who understand the language are taken into account\n4. Whether people who can read the language are taken into account\n\nOption 1 directly matches the key sentence in the passage.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a terrorist attack in Mumbai on November 26, 2008.\n2. It mentions that the attackers brought grenades and automatic weapons.\n3. The attackers targeted several locations, including a crowded railway station and a famous hotel.\n4. The key sentence for the question is: \"Совершившие террористическую атаку в Мумбаи прибыли на лодке 26 ноября 2008 года...\" which translates to \"Those who committed the terrorist attack in Mumbai arrived by boat on November 26, 2008...\"\n5. The question asks: \"What type of transport did the militants use to arrive in Mumbai?\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Train\n2. Airplane\n3. Boat\n4. Car\n\nFrom the passage, it is clear that the attackers arrived by boat.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the traditional medieval castle and the images it evokes: duels, feasts, and knightly nobility from the legends of King Arthur.\n2. It mentions that even among ancient ruins, one can imagine the sounds and smells of past battles, the clatter of hooves on the pavement, and the fear emanating from the dungeons.\n3. The passage then questions whether our fantasies are based on reality and asks why these castles were built and how they were designed.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Подземелья (Dungeons) — The passage mentions \"страх, исходящий из ям в подземельях\" (\"fear emanating from the dungeons\"), so dungeons are mentioned.\n2. Поединки (Duels) — The passage says \"картины поединков\" (\"images of duels\"), so duels are mentioned.\n3. Благородство (Nobility) — The passage says \"рыцарского благородства\" (\"knightly nobility\"), so nobility is mentioned.\n4. Рыцари (Knights) — The passage refers to \"рыцарского благородства\" (\"knightly nobility\") and \"легенд о короле Артуре\" (legends of King Arthur), but does not directly mention \"рыцари\" (knights) as a noun, only as an adjective (\"knightly\").\n\nHowever, the adjective \"рыцарского\" (knightly) is derived from \"рыцарь\" (knight), and the context is about knights, but the word \"рыцари\" (knights) itself is not explicitly mentioned as a noun in the passage.\n\nThe question asks: \"Что не упоминается в приведённом тексте как нечто, что можно ассоциировать со средневековыми замками?\" (\"What is NOT mentioned in the passage as something that can be associated with medieval castles?\")\n\nGiven that \"рыцарского благородства\" (knightly nobility) is mentioned, but the word \"рыцари\" (knights) as a noun is not, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses two main events:\n   - The \"Clean Air Act\" being sent to a committee after a meeting between Prime Minister Stephen Harper and NDP leader Jack Layton.\n   - The federal government's intervention in funding the Mercy Hospital in Devonport, Tasmania, which was criticized as a pre-election ploy.\n\n2. The question asks: Who refuted the claim that the \"Clean Air Act\" was used as a pre-election ploy?\n\n3. In the passage, the criticism of a pre-election ploy is actually about the hospital funding, not the \"Clean Air Act.\" However, the structure of the passage links the idea of refuting a pre-election ploy to the actions of a prime minister.\n\n4. The passage says: \"Но премьер-министр Джон Ховард заявил, что это было сделано лишь для защиты больницы от снижения финансирования правительством Тасмании с помощью выделения дополнительных 45 миллионов австралийских долларов.\"\n   - Translation: \"But Prime Minister John Howard stated that this was done only to protect the hospital from funding cuts by the Tasmanian government by allocating an additional 45 million Australian dollars.\"\n   - This is a direct refutation of the claim that the action was a pre-election ploy.\n\n5. The options:\n   1. Member of the state government\n   2. Prime Minister\n   3. NDP leader\n   4. Member of the federal parliament\n\n6. The correct answer is the Prime Minister, as he is the one who refuted the claim.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses what to consider when crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter.\n2. It specifically mentions that you should \"узнайте насчёт расположения каюты\" (find out about the location of your cabin), because passing over ice can cause a lot of noise, which may disturb sensitive sleepers.\n3. The other parts of the passage talk about cruises to St. Petersburg, mentioning city tours and visa requirements, but these are not directly related to what to check if the cruise is in winter.\n4. The question asks: \"What should a passenger check if the cruise is in winter?\" According to the passage, the answer is the location of the cabin, due to the noise from ice.\n\nCorrect option:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage and the question step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions several people:\n   - Сакис Кечагиоглоу and Георг Николакопулос: They are described as \"famous Greek lawyers\" (\"Знаменитые греческие юристы\").\n   - Петрос Мантувалос: He is described as a \"member of parliament and lawyer\" (\"член парламента и юрист\").\n   - Макис Триантафилопулос: He is described as a \"journalist\" who revealed information on his TV show.\n\n2. The question asks: \"Who among the listed people is NOT a lawyer?\"\n\n3. Let's check each option:\n   - 1. Петрос Мантувалос: The passage says he is a lawyer.\n   - 2. Сакис Кечагиоглоу: The passage says he is a lawyer.\n   - 3. Георг Николакопулос: The passage says he is a lawyer.\n   - 4. Макис Триантафилопулос: The passage says he is a journalist, not a lawyer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the person who is not a lawyer, which is Макис Триантафилопулос.\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that Tropical Storm \"Daniella\" is the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season and formed in the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean.\n2. The storm is about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, which means it is far from the coast.\n3. The maximum sustained wind speed is 40 mph (64 km/h).\n4. Scientists from the National Hurricane Center predict that by Wednesday, \"Daniella\" will strengthen into a hurricane.\n5. The storm is still far from the shore, so it is difficult to assess its possible impact on the Caribbean countries and the USA.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Its impact on the Caribbean countries is unknown — This is correct according to the passage (\"тяжело оценить его возможное влияние на страны Карибского бассейна и США\").\n2. It formed in the Atlantic Ocean — This is correct (\"образовался в восточной части Атлантического океана\").\n3. It may become a hurricane — This is correct (\"предсказывают, что к среде \"\"Даниэль\"\" усилится до урагана\").\n4. It is near the shore — This is NOT correct. The passage says it is about 3000 miles from Miami and \"далеко от берега\" (far from the shore).\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true according to the passage is option 4.\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes an oil spill incident near Fairbanks, Alaska, involving the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n2. It states that a power outage occurred after a scheduled fire system test.\n3. This power outage led to the opening of safety (relief) valves.\n4. The opening of these valves caused a pressure drop in the system, resulting in oil spilling into a containment area.\n5. The passage mentions that there was still a leak in the vent holes, possibly due to thermal expansion, but this is not directly linked to the initial opening of the safety valves.\n6. The passage does not say the tanks were completely full, nor does it say the auxiliary containment area was unable to hold enough volume at the time of the incident.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. Thermal expansion in the tanks — mentioned as a possible reason for continued leakage, not for the opening of the valves.\n2. Power outage after fire system testing — directly stated as the cause for the opening of the safety valves.\n3. Tanks were completely full — not mentioned as the cause.\n4. Auxiliary containment area couldn't hold enough — not mentioned as the cause.\n\nThe correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that Batten was ranked 190th on the list of the 400 richest Americans in 2008, with a net worth of $2.3 billion.\n2. It also says he graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia in 1950.\n3. Importantly, the passage mentions he was a significant sponsor of this institution.\n4. The question asks: \"To which of the following did Batten make a donation?\"\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"The list of the richest Americans\" — This is not an institution and not something one can donate to.\n   - Option 2: \"University of Virginia\" — The passage says he was a major sponsor of this institution, which matches this option.\n   - Option 3: \"A significant number of institutions\" — The passage only mentions one institution, not many.\n   - Option 4: \"Colleges of arts and sciences\" — The passage refers to the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia, not to multiple colleges in general.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage describes two main types of tourism: recreational tourism and cultural tourism.\n- Recreational tourism is about relaxing and having fun, often in places like beaches, theme parks, and campsites.\n- Cultural tourism is when the goal is to learn about the history and culture of a place. Tourists visit attractions related to history and culture.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"К какой категории туризма относится посещение музея?\"  \nTranslation: \"To which category of tourism does visiting a museum belong?\"\n\nVisiting a museum is typically for learning about history and culture, not just for relaxation or entertainment.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Business tourism\n2. Recreational tourism\n3. Cultural tourism\n4. Active tourism\n\nBased on the passage, visiting a museum fits the description of cultural tourism.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes events around September 17, 1939, during the invasion of Poland.\n2. It states that the Polish defense was already broken, and their only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.\n3. However, these plans became irrelevant overnight because about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after capturing the eastern regions of Poland.\n4. The passage specifically says this action was \"in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.\"\n5. The question asks: \"According to the text, who violated the agreement?\"\n6. The options are: 1. Poles, 2. Romanians, 3. Ukrainians, 4. Soviet Union.\n7. The passage clearly states that it was the Soviet Red Army (i.e., the Soviet Union) that violated the agreements by invading eastern Poland.\n\nAnswer:\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses two main events: \n   - The \"Clean Air Act\" being sent to a committee after a meeting between Prime Minister Stephen Harper and NDP leader Jack Layton.\n   - A separate issue about hospital funding in Tasmania involving Prime Minister John Howard.\n\n2. The question asks: \"Who proposed making changes to the 'Clean Air Act'?\"\n\n3. The relevant part of the passage is: \"На встрече с премьер-министром Лейтон попросил внести изменения и 'полностью переписать' экологический законопроект Консервативной партии.\" \n   - Translation: \"At the meeting with the Prime Minister, Layton asked to make changes and 'completely rewrite' the Conservative Party's environmental bill.\"\n\n4. This clearly states that Jack Layton (Джек Лейтон) proposed making changes to the bill.\n\n5. The options are:\n   1. John Howard (not relevant to the Clean Air Act, involved in the hospital issue)\n   2. Conservative Party (they wrote the bill, but did not propose changes)\n   3. Jack Layton (correct, as per the passage)\n   4. Stephen Harper (Prime Minister, but not the one who proposed changes)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses vision (зрение) and states that the ability to see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, specifically the eyes.\n2. It then elaborates that there are many different eye structures, whose complexity varies depending on the needs of the organism.\n3. These different constructions provide various capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths, and have different degrees of acuity.\n4. Additionally, they require different processing to interpret input data and different numbers for optimal functioning.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"От органов чувств зрительной системы\" — This means \"on the sensory organs of the visual system.\" The passage directly states that vision depends on these organs, specifically the eyes.\n2. \"От потребностей организма\" — \"on the needs of the organism.\" The passage says the complexity of the eye varies depending on the needs, but not that the ability to see itself depends on this.\n3. \"От чувствительности к определённым длинам волн\" — \"on sensitivity to certain wavelengths.\" The passage says different eyes are sensitive to different wavelengths, but again, this is a characteristic, not the fundamental dependency for vision.\n4. \"От различной степени остроты\" — \"on different degrees of acuity.\" The passage mentions acuity as a variable, but not as the basis for the ability to see.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 1, as the passage explicitly states that the ability to see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains the notation and technique for bow movement in string instruments (like violin).\n2. The \"up-bow\" is indicated by a \"V\" sign. \"Up\" means you start from the tip and move the bow forward.\n3. The \"down-bow\" is indicated by a bracket or a square missing its bottom side. \"Down\" means you start from the place where your hand holds the bow and move it backward.\n4. The up-bow (moving forward from the tip) usually produces a softer sound.\n5. The down-bow (moving backward from the frog/hand) usually produces a stronger, more forceful sound.\n\nNow, the question asks: \"According to the passage, which of the following is NOT associated with moving the bow backward?\"\n\nLet's check each option:\n\n1. \"Более мягкий звук\" — \"A softer sound.\" The passage says a softer sound is associated with the up-bow (moving forward), not with moving backward.\n2. \"Знак в виде скобы\" — \"A sign in the form of a bracket.\" The passage says the down-bow (moving backward) is indicated by a bracket.\n3. \"Более сильный звук\" — \"A stronger sound.\" The passage says the down-bow (moving backward) produces a stronger sound.\n4. \"Начало с места, где рука держит смычок\" — \"Starting from the place where the hand holds the bow.\" The passage says the down-bow (moving backward) starts from where the hand holds the bow.\n\nSo, the only option NOT associated with moving the bow backward is option 1: \"A softer sound.\"\n\nAnswer:\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides. This supports the idea that they are very social.\n2. It mentions that the behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf or dog packs, which are surprisingly similar to lions in their habits (but not to other big cats).\n3. It also says that these animals (wolves, dogs, and lions) are very dangerous to their prey.\n4. Importantly, the passage specifically states that lions' behavior is NOT like that of other big cats.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Они очень социальны\" — \"They are very social.\" This is supported by the passage.\n2. \"Их поведение сравнимо с поведением волков\" — \"Their behavior is comparable to that of wolves.\" This is also supported by the passage.\n3. \"Самцы и самки очень опасны для своих жертв\" — \"Males and females are very dangerous to their prey.\" The passage says lions are very dangerous to their prey, so this is accurate.\n4. \"Их поведение похоже на поведение других крупных кошек\" — \"Their behavior is similar to that of other big cats.\" The passage specifically says this is NOT true.\n\nTherefore, the statement that does NOT accurately describe lion behavior is option 4.\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes two classes of suburban trains in Cape Town: \"MetroPlus\" (first class) and \"Metro\" (third class).\n2. \"MetroPlus\" is described as more comfortable and having fewer passengers, but it is a bit more expensive. However, it is still cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe.\n3. Both types of carriages are present in every train. The \"MetroPlus\" carriages are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: What is the advantage of first-class tickets in MetroRail suburban trains in Cape Town?\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. The carriage is at the beginning of the train — The passage says \"always at the end of the train, closest to Cape Town,\" so this is incorrect.\n2. Fewer passengers — The passage explicitly says \"there are fewer passengers\" in \"MetroPlus,\" so this is correct.\n3. Cheaper than third-class ticket — The passage says \"MetroPlus\" is more expensive than \"Metro,\" so this is incorrect.\n4. Costs the same as a Metro ticket — The passage says \"a bit more expensive,\" so this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that proper nutrition alone will not lead to the highest results, but it can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.\n2. It mentions that maintaining a healthy energy balance, effective hydration habits, and understanding supplements can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sports.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: Which of the following is NOT recommended for young athletes to increase their enjoyment of sports?\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n1. Proper nutrition – The passage says this is beneficial.\n2. Constantly achieving the highest results – The passage specifically says that proper nutrition alone will not lead to the highest results, and the focus is on health and enjoyment, not on always achieving the highest results.\n3. Effective hydration – The passage recommends this.\n4. Maintaining a healthy energy balance – The passage recommends this.\n\nSo, the only option that is NOT recommended (and is not mentioned as a way to increase enjoyment) is \"constantly achieving the highest results.\"\n\nThe correct answer is:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the difference between running a quarter mile and a half mile. It says that as the distance increases from a quarter to a half mile, speed becomes less important, and endurance becomes absolutely necessary.\n2. It mentions that a top-class half-mile runner (someone who can run the distance in less than two minutes) must have considerable speed, but above all, endurance must be trained at all costs.\n3. The passage then suggests that some cross-country running in winter, combined with upper body gym work, is the best preparation for the running season.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Бег по пересечённой местности в зимние месяцы\" — Cross-country running in winter months. This is mentioned as good preparation, but not as the most important quality for a top-class half-mile runner.\n2. \"Тренировка в первую очередь выносливости, а не скорости\" — Training primarily endurance, not speed. The passage emphasizes that endurance is absolutely necessary and must be trained above all.\n3. \"Способность пробежать дистанцию менее чем за две минуты\" — The ability to run the distance in less than two minutes. This is a characteristic of a top-class runner, but the passage says that to achieve this, endurance is most important.\n4. \"Тренировка в первую очередь скорости, а не выносливости\" — Training primarily speed, not endurance. The passage says the opposite: endurance is more important than speed for the half-mile.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, as the passage stresses the primary importance of endurance training over speed for a top-class half-mile runner.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the difficulty primates with a human-like digestive system have in meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources in the savanna.\n2. It states that plant proteins (from leaves and legumes) are not easily digestible by such primates unless cooked.\n3. In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are described as easily digestible and rich in proteins containing all essential amino acids.\n4. The passage concludes that our ancestors solved the \"protein problem\" similarly to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today—by consuming animal-based foods.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. \"Опавшие листья\" (fallen leaves) – The passage says leaf proteins are not easily digestible.\n2. \"Сырые бобовые\" (raw legumes) – The passage says legumes are not easily digestible unless cooked.\n3. \"Кузнечиков\" (grasshoppers) – Grasshoppers are animal-based food, similar to ants and termites mentioned as good sources of protein.\n4. \"Стебли цветов\" (flower stems) – Not mentioned as a good protein source, and likely similar to leaves in being hard to digest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the animal-based option, which is grasshoppers.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions that there are now four-month-old mice that no longer have diabetes.\n2. Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine and chair of the clinical-scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association, warns that the research is still in its early stages.\n3. Like some other experts, he doubts that diabetes is curable, noting that these findings do not apply to people who already have type 1 diabetes.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"According to the passage, what does Dr. Ur doubt?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n1. Whether the findings apply to people who have type 1 diabetes.\n   - The passage says: \"he doubts that diabetes is curable, noting that these findings do not apply to people who already have type 1 diabetes.\" This matches the idea that he doubts the applicability of the findings to people with type 1 diabetes.\n\n2. Whether treatment is possible.\n   - The passage says he doubts that diabetes is curable, but the main focus is on the applicability of the findings to humans with type 1 diabetes, not just the possibility of treatment in general.\n\n3. The opinions of other experts regarding treatment.\n   - The passage says \"like some other experts,\" but does not say he doubts their opinions.\n\n4. Whether the mice that no longer have diabetes will remain so.\n   - The passage does not mention this.\n\nThe best match is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage is about the USA Gymnastics Federation's response to the abuse cases involving Larry Nassar.\n2. The Federation supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and agrees on the absolute necessity of creating a safe environment for athletes.\n3. The Federation agrees with the USOC that reforms should be made within the organization, rather than revoking its certification.\n4. The Federation supports an independent investigation to shed light on how the abuse could go unnoticed for so long.\n5. The Federation supports all necessary and appropriate changes.\n6. Both organizations have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so athletes can pursue their goals in a safe, positive environment with all rights.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Annulment of certification — The passage says the Federation does NOT support this; they prefer internal reforms.\n2. Creating an environment endowed with all necessary rights — The Federation supports this.\n3. Necessary changes within the organization — The Federation supports this.\n4. Independent investigation — The Federation supports this.\n\nSo, the only thing the Federation does NOT support is the annulment of certification.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the need for professional training for those planning to visit countries that may be considered war zones.\n2. It mentions searching for a \"hostile environment safety course\" and says such a course covers all the topics mentioned in the passage, often with practical training.\n3. The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes scenario play, a large amount of information on first aid, and sometimes weapons training.\n4. The passage also notes that books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Оказание первой помощи (First aid) – The passage specifically says the course includes a large amount of information on first aid.\n2. Зоны боевых действий (War zones) – The passage says the course is for those going to war zones, but it doesn't say the course is about war zones themselves.\n3. Выживание в диких условиях (Wilderness survival) – The passage contrasts this with the course, saying wilderness survival is common in books, but not the focus here.\n4. Враждебная среда (Hostile environment) – The course is called a \"hostile environment safety course,\" but the passage focuses on what is taught, not just the environment.\n\nThe most direct answer, based on what is specifically covered in the course, is \"first aid,\" as the passage says: \"большой объем информации по оказанию первой помощи\" (a large amount of information on first aid).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage says: \"Растения производят кислород, которым дышит человек, и поглощают углекислый газ, который человек выдыхает.\"  \n  Translation: \"Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.\"\n- The question asks: \"Что люди выдыхают, а растения вдыхают?\"  \n  Translation: \"What do people exhale, and plants inhale?\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Пищу — Food. This is not something people exhale or plants inhale.\n2. Кислород — Oxygen. The passage says people breathe in oxygen, not exhale it.\n3. Воду — Water. Not mentioned as something exhaled by people and inhaled by plants.\n4. Углекислый газ — Carbon dioxide. The passage explicitly says people exhale carbon dioxide and plants absorb (inhale) it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 4.\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a real castle, which is typical for that period.\n2. It mentions that the castle has huge glazed windows and thin walls, which could not withstand a powerful attack for long.\n3. In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began its construction, the country was relatively peaceful, and only protection from small bands of marauders was needed.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Толстые стены замка были возведены по требованию лорда Гастингса\" — \"The thick walls of the castle were built at the request of Lord Hastings.\"  \n   - This is incorrect. The passage says the walls were thin, not thick.\n\n2. \"Во время строительства в стране было спокойно, поэтому требовалось лишь небольшое укрепление\" — \"During construction, the country was peaceful, so only minor fortification was needed.\"  \n   - This matches the passage, which says the country was relatively peaceful and only protection from small bands was needed.\n\n3. \"Конструкция замка не была характерной для того времени\" — \"The design of the castle was not typical for that time.\"  \n   - The passage says the design (fortified house rather than a real castle) was typical for that period.\n\n4. \"Замок был построен, чтобы выдерживать мощные и длительные атаки\" — \"The castle was built to withstand powerful and prolonged attacks.\"  \n   - This is incorrect. The passage says the castle could not withstand a powerful attack for long.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage states that the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed by arson committed by Herostratus in 356 BCE.\n2. Alexander the Great was born on the same night as the destruction.\n3. Later, as king, Alexander offered to pay for the restoration of the temple, but his offer was declined.\n4. The temple was restored in 323 BCE, after Alexander's death.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Alexander the Great paid for the restoration\" — This is incorrect. The passage says his offer was declined.\n2. \"The temple was restored after the reign of Alexander the Great\" — This is correct. The passage says the temple was restored in 323 BCE, after Alexander's death.\n3. \"Herostratus was ordered to pay for the restoration\" — This is not mentioned in the passage.\n4. \"The temple was restored in 320 BCE\" — The passage says 323 BCE, so this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars.\n2. It specifically says that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness (светимостью), rotation (вращением), and nothing else.\n3. The combination of luminosity (brightness) and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number (число Россби) of a star, which is related to plasma flow.\n4. The passage further explains that the lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field inversions.\n5. The question asks: What causes the activity of the Sun and other stars?\n6. The passage directly says that activity is determined by brightness and rotation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. Luminosity and plasma flow — plasma flow is related, but not directly stated as a cause; the passage says activity is determined by luminosity and rotation.\n2. Rossby number, rotation, and magnetic field inversions — Rossby number is derived from luminosity and rotation, and magnetic field inversions are a result, not a cause.\n3. Rotation and luminosity — this matches exactly what the passage says.\n4. Luminosity, Rossby number, and rotation — Rossby number is not a direct cause, but a derived value from luminosity and rotation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\nThe passage says that the Australian Communications and Media Authority determined that although the video was streamed online, \"Big Brother\" did not violate online content censorship laws because the multimedia material was not stored on the \"Big Brother\" website. The law regulates internet content, but for something to be considered internet content, it must physically reside on a server.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: What criteria must multimedia material meet to be considered internet content?\n\nOption 1: Must be streamed on the Internet  \n- The passage says streaming alone is not enough.\n\nOption 2: Must physically reside on a server  \n- The passage explicitly states that for something to be considered internet content, it must physically be on a server.\n\nOption 3: Cannot be stored on the site  \n- The passage says the opposite: if it is not stored, it is not considered internet content.\n\nOption 4: Must be approved by the Australian Communications and Media Authority  \n- The passage does not mention this as a criterion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage says the Sun does not have a crust like the Earth, so option 1 (\"Кора\" = \"crust\") is not correct.\n- The Sun is made of gases, fire, and plasma, but the passage specifically asks which part is visible from Earth.\n- The passage states: \"The outer part, which we see when we look at the Sun, is called the photosphere, which means 'sphere of light.'\"\n- Option 3 is \"Фотосфера\" (\"photosphere\"), which matches the passage's description of the visible part.\n- Option 2 (\"Плазма\" = \"plasma\") is a general component of the Sun, but the passage specifies the photosphere as the visible part.\n- Option 4 (\"Центр\" = \"center\") is not visible from Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "First, let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage discusses a PBS series with over two dozen Emmy awards, second in longevity only to \"Sesame Street\" and \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.\"\n- Each episode focuses on a theme from a book and explores it through stories, recommending books for children to find at the library.\n- John Grant from WNED Buffalo (where Reading Rainbow is shown) is quoted, praising the show for encouraging children to read.\n- The passage states: \"Некоторые, включая Джона Гранта, считают, что к завершению сериала привели одновременно и нехватка финансирования, и смена концепции образовательных ТВ-программ.\" This translates to: \"Some, including John Grant, believe that the ending of the series was caused by both a lack of funding and a change in the concept of educational TV programs.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. Недостаточное финансирование — Lack of funding. This is directly mentioned as one of the reasons.\n2. Недостаточное количество наград «Эмми» — Not enough Emmy awards. The passage says the show had over two dozen Emmys, so this is not a reason.\n3. Мнение Джона Гранта — John Grant's opinion. While he is quoted, his opinion alone is not the reason; he is among those who believe in the actual reasons.\n4. Успех шоу «Окрестности дома мистера Роджерса» — The success of \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.\" The passage only mentions this show in terms of longevity, not as a reason for cancellation.\n\nThe correct answer, based on the passage, is option 1: lack of funding.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the indigenous groups living in what is now eastern Paraguay, specifically the Guarani, who were semi-nomadic hunters and practiced subsistence agriculture.\n2. It also mentions the Chaco region, home to other indigenous groups like the Guaycuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.\n3. The key sentence for the question is: \"В XVI веке Парагвай, который до этого называли 'огромной провинцией Ост-Индии', возник в результате столкновения испанских завоевателей с местными группами коренного населения. Испанцы начали период колонизации, который длился три столетия.\"\n   - Translation: \"In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called 'the vast province of the East Indies,' arose as a result of the clash between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups. The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.\"\n4. The question asks: \"Which group began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries?\"\n5. The passage clearly states that it was the Spaniards (Испанцы) who began the colonization period.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Паягуа (Payagua) – indigenous group\n2. Гуайкуру (Guaycuru) – indigenous group\n3. Гуарани (Guarani) – indigenous group\n4. Испанцы (Spaniards) – colonizers\n\nThe correct answer is option 4.\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes an incident involving a Twin Otter aircraft operating as flight CG4684 for Airlines PNG.\n2. The passage states that the aircraft attempted to land in Kokoda but was unable to complete the landing attempt.\n3. It specifically mentions that the same bad weather that prevented the landing also hampered the search for survivors.\n4. The passage does not mention anything about the landing site being inaccessible, other planes being ahead, or the plane being redirected to Kokoda.\n5. The only reason given for the aborted landing is the bad weather.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that avalanches are not an anomaly; steep slopes can only hold a limited amount of snow, and the excess snow comes down as avalanches.\n2. It further explains that snow is sticky, so some kind of impact is needed for it to slide down, and a small amount of sliding snow can trigger the rest.\n3. The passage mentions that triggers can be sunlight, more snowfall, other natural phenomena, or humans.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Липкий снег без внешнего воздействия\" — \"Sticky snow without external impact.\" The passage says sticky snow needs an impact to move, so this is not correct.\n2. \"Крутые бесснежные склоны\" — \"Steep snowless slopes.\" The passage is about snow on slopes, not bare slopes, so this is not correct.\n3. \"Избыточные объёмы снега на крутых склонах\" — \"Excess amounts of snow on steep slopes.\" The passage directly says that excess snow on steep slopes comes down as avalanches. This matches the passage.\n4. \"Снег, который не подвергался воздействию человека\" — \"Snow that has not been affected by humans.\" The passage says avalanches can be triggered by humans, but not only by humans, so this is not the main point.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage and each option step by step:\n\n**Passage summary:**\n- Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.\n- A pride consists of 1-3 related adult males, as well as females and cubs, up to 30 individuals.\n- Females are usually related to each other, forming a big family of sisters and daughters.\n- Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs—animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.\n\n**Now, let's analyze each option:**\n\n1. \"Их поведение похоже на поведение стаи собак\"  \n   (\"Their behavior is similar to that of a pack of dogs\")  \n   The passage explicitly states that lion prides behave very similarly to wolf or dog packs. So this is accurate.\n\n2. \"Соотношение самцов и самок не равное\"  \n   (\"The ratio of males to females is not equal\")  \n   The passage says there are 1-3 adult males and the rest are females and cubs, up to 30 individuals. This means the number of females is much higher than males, so the ratio is not equal. This is accurate.\n\n3. \"Самцы и самки находятся в родстве\"  \n   (\"Males and females are related to each other\")  \n   The passage says the males in the pride are related to each other, and the females are related to each other, but it does NOT say that males and females are related to each other. In fact, in lion prides, males and females are usually not closely related (males often come from outside the pride). So this statement is NOT accurate.\n\n4. \"Они одновременно опасны и социальны\"  \n   (\"They are both dangerous and social at the same time\")  \n   The passage says lions are the most social cats and are very dangerous to their prey. So this is accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOption 3 is the only statement that does NOT accurately describe a lion pride according to the passage.\n\n3",
      "First, let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.\n- About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.\n- Most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the primary official language by law.\n- Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public places.\n- Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan.\n- Unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Which of the listed languages is used in the Barcelona metro for regular announcements?\"\n\nOptions:\n1. English\n2. Catalan\n3. Spanish\n4. French\n\nFrom the passage, it is clear that regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan. Other languages, including Spanish, English, and French, are used only for unplanned disruptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",

The passage says: \"Шумахер, который закончил карьеру в 2006 году после того, как стал семикратным чемпионом 'Формулы-1'...\"  \n   Translation: \"Schumacher, who ended his career in 2006 after becoming a seven-time Formula 1 champion...\"\n\n2. The passage then discusses that Schumacher was supposed to replace Felipe Massa, who was injured in 2009.  \n   This means Schumacher had already retired before Massa's accident.\n\n3. The question asks: \"When did Schumacher end his career?\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. After Felipe Massa's accident  \n   - Incorrect. Schumacher retired in 2006, Massa's accident was in 2009.\n\n2. After his seventh championship win  \n   - This matches the passage: he retired in 2006 after becoming a seven-time champion.\n\n3. After replacing Felipe Massa  \n   - Incorrect. He was supposed to replace Massa after Massa's accident, but he had already retired.\n\n4. At the end of the 2009 season  \n   - Incorrect. He retired in 2006.\n\nThe correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the journey of the \"Dunlap broadsides\" (листовки Данлэпа), which are early printed copies of a significant document (the Declaration of Independence).\n2. The process started with the handwritten draft being sent to John Dunlap's print shop (печатная мастерская Данлапа), where the broadsides were printed overnight.\n3. The first public reading was in the courtyard of Independence Hall (Индепенденс-холл) on July 8.\n4. On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York (Нью-Йорк) on July 9.\n5. A copy arrived in London (Лондон) on August 10.\n\nNow, let's look at the options and determine which place received the broadsides last:\n\n- New York: The document was read to troops on July 9.\n- Dunlap's print shop: This is where the broadsides were first produced, so this is the earliest.\n- London: The copy arrived on August 10, which is after all the other mentioned dates.\n- Independence Hall: The first public reading was on July 8.\n\nComparing the dates:\n- Print shop: night of July 4-5 (earliest)\n- Independence Hall: July 8\n- New York: July 9\n- London: August 10 (latest)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage is about Leonov, a Soviet cosmonaut, who was the first person to perform a spacewalk.\n2. It mentions that ten years after his spacewalk, Leonov led the Soviet part of a mission called \"Soyuz-Apollo,\" which symbolized the end of the space race.\n3. The question asks: \"Leonov led the Soviet part of which mission?\"\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Космическая гонка\" (\"Space race\") — This is not a specific mission, but a period of competition.\n   - Option 2: \"«Союз» — «Аполлон»\" (\"Soyuz-Apollo\") — This matches the passage, which says Leonov led the Soviet part of the Soyuz-Apollo mission.\n   - Option 3: \"Космонавт № 11\" (\"Cosmonaut No. 11\") — This is Leonov's nickname, not a mission.\n   - Option 4: \"ВКД\" (\"EVA\" or \"extravehicular activity\") — This refers to a spacewalk, not a mission.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the inclusion of golf and rugby in the Olympic Games program by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\n2. It mentions that rugby (specifically rugby union) and golf were chosen over five other sports for consideration in the Olympic program.\n3. The passage lists squash, karate, and roller skating as sports that tried to be included in the Olympic program.\n4. It also mentions baseball and softball, stating that \"бейсбол и софтбол, которые по результату голосования были исключены из Олимпийских игр в 2005 году,\" which translates to \"baseball and softball, which as a result of the vote were excluded from the Olympic Games in 2005.\"\n5. The question asks which of the listed sports were excluded from the Olympic program.\n6. Looking at the options:\n   - 1. Squash: Tried to be included, not mentioned as excluded.\n   - 2.

      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat.\n2. It mentions that if someone cannot cook, their choices are limited to ready-to-eat food.\n3. The passage then states that supermarkets are increasingly expanding the range of their ready-to-eat food sections.\n4. It also mentions that some supermarkets provide microwaves or other means to heat food, and that in some countries or store formats, there is at least one simple, affordable restaurant inside.\n5. The question asks: According to the passage, what are supermarkets starting to offer a more diverse selection of?\n6. Option 1 is \"готовая еда\" (ready-to-eat food), which matches the passage's statement about expanding the range of ready-to-eat food.\n7. Option 2 is \"микроволновые печи\" (microwaves), but the passage only says some supermarkets provide them, not that the variety is increasing.\n8. Option 3 is \"рестораны на территории супермаркета\" (restaurants inside the supermarket), but the passage says there is at least one, not that the variety is increasing.\n9. Option 4 is \"доступные цены\" (affordable prices), but the passage does not say the variety of prices is increasing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\n- The passage describes an incident at the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008, where Piquet Jr. crashed after Alonso's early pit stop, leading to a safety car deployment. This allowed Alonso to move up and win the race.\n- The passage then states that Piquet Jr. was not allowed to race after the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Which statement accurately describes the result of the Hungarian Grand Prix 2009?\"\n\nOption analysis:\n1. \"Fernando Alonso participated in an accident\" — The passage does not mention Alonso being in an accident at the Hungarian GP 2009.\n2. \"Piquet Jr. won\" — The passage does not say Piquet Jr. won the Hungarian GP 2009.\n3. \"Piquet Jr. was fired after this\" — The passage says Piquet Jr. was not allowed to race after the Hungarian GP 2009, which means he was effectively fired after that race.\n4. \"The safety car participated in an accident\" — The passage does not mention the safety car being in an accident at the Hungarian GP 2009.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that matches the passage is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The protest began at 11:00 local time on Whitehall street, opposite a police-guarded entrance to Downing Street, which is the official residence of the Prime Minister.\n2. The passage specifically mentions that the entrance to Downing Street was guarded by the police.\n3. The police later asked protesters to return to the sidewalk to balance the right to protest and traffic flow.\n4. The protesters then moved past several landmarks, including Trafalgar Square, Strand, Aldwych, and up Kingsway towards Holborn, where the Conservative Party was holding its Spring Forum at the Grand Connaught Rooms hotel.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Trafalgar Square – The passage mentions protesters passed by it, but does not say it was guarded by police.\n2. Spring Forum – The event location, but no mention of police guarding it.\n3. Entrance to Downing Street – The passage explicitly says this was guarded by police.\n4. Grand Connaught Rooms hotel – The location of the forum, but again, no mention of police guarding it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a theoretical study, with a program simulating observations of the Sagittarius galaxy (галактика в Стрельце).\n2. The effect being studied is caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the Sagittarius galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way (Млечный Путь).\n3. The passage uses the analogy of the Moon and Earth to explain tidal forces, but the actual scientific focus is on the interaction between the Milky Way and the Sagittarius galaxy.\n4. The conclusion is that dark matter interacts with other dark matter similarly to how ordinary matter does, and much of the dark matter around the Galaxy (Milky Way) is in a halo of small particles.\n5. The question asks: \"Учёные наблюдали за материей чего из перечисленного?\" — \"The scientists observed the matter of which of the following?\"\n6. The options:\n   - 1. Milky Way and Moon\n   - 2. Earth and Sagittarius galaxy\n   - 3. Earth and Moon\n   - 4. Sagittarius galaxy and Milky Way\n\n7. The correct answer must be the two galaxies: Sagittarius and Milky Way, as the study is about their dark matter and tidal interactions.\n\nFinal answer:\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses annual festivals held in most temples from late November to mid-May, with dates depending on each temple's calendar.\n2. These festivals are related to temple anniversaries, deity birthdays, or other significant temple events.\n3. The passage specifically mentions that temple festivals in Kerala are interesting to watch and are accompanied by processions of decorated elephants, temple orchestra performances, and other celebrations.\n4. The key detail is that decorated elephants are seen in processions during temple festivals.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. \"Everywhere from late November to mid-May\" — This is too broad; the passage specifies temple festivals, not everywhere.\n2. \"In temples\" — While the festivals are temple-related, the passage specifies processions, not just inside temples.\n3. \"In processions during temple festivals\" — This matches the passage exactly: decorated elephants are seen in processions during temple festivals.\n4. \"On the streets in Kerala\" — The passage does not mention elephants on the streets generally, only in the context of temple festival processions.\n\nThe correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage:\n\nThe passage says that research in the twentieth century showed there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed. It then says: \"Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of expressed variations. Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between the two pools with each generation.\"\n\nNow, the question is: \"Which process is responsible for introducing genetic variation?\"\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\n1. Segregation – The passage says segregation shuffles existing variation, not introduces new variation.\n2. Recombination – The passage says recombination also shuffles existing variation, not introduces new variation.\n3. Mutation – The passage explicitly says \"Mutation introduces new genetic variation.\"\n4. Expressed variability – This is a type of variability, not a process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage says that hostels are mainly for young people, typically aged 20 to 30, but sometimes you can also meet older travelers.\n2. It also mentions that families with children are rarely seen in hostels, but some hostels allow them to stay in private rooms.\n3. The question asks: According to the text, which guests are less likely to be found in a shared hostel room?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Young guests in their early twenties — the passage says these are typical guests.\n   - Option 2: Individual travelers — the passage does not say they are rare; in fact, hostels are popular among solo travelers.\n   - Option 3: Guests traveling with small children — the passage says families with children are rarely seen, and when they are, some hostels allow them in private rooms (not shared rooms).\n   - Option 4: Guests around 35 years old — the passage says you can sometimes meet older travelers, so they are not the least likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3, as guests with small children are rarely seen in shared rooms, and if they are present, they usually stay in private rooms.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how children become aware of racial stereotypes at an early age and that these stereotypes influence their behavior.\n2. It gives an example: there is a stereotype that children from racial minorities do poorly in school. When children who identify as racial minorities learn about this stereotype, they immediately stop performing well in school.\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, knowledge of a racial stereotype can influence a child in which of the listed aspects?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"The racial minority to which the child identifies\" — The passage does not say that knowledge of the stereotype changes which minority the child identifies with.\n   - Option 2: \"Behavior\" — The passage explicitly says that stereotypes influence behavior, giving the example of academic performance changing after learning about the stereotype.\n   - Option 3: \"Relationships with other children\" — The passage does not mention relationships with peers.\n   - Option 4: \"The definition of race used by the child\" — The passage does not discuss how children define race.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that matches the passage: behavior.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage says that permits for camping below the rim of the Grand Canyon are limited and become available on the 1st day of the month, four months before the month of the trip.\n2. It gives an example: a permit for any start date in May becomes available on January 1st.\n3. The question asks: When does a permit for a start date in August become available?\n4. To find this, count four months back from August:\n   - August (target month)\n   - July (1 month back)\n   - June (2 months back)\n   - May (3 months back)\n   - April (4 months back)\n5. Therefore, permits for August become available on April 1st.\n\nAnswer:\n2"

      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Olympics and will be the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics.\n2. In Beijing, the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor ice events will be held.\n3. Additionally, ski competitions will be held at Taizicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km from Beijing.\n4. The question asks: According to the passage, which of the following will NOT be held in Beijing in 2022?\n5. Option 1: Opening ceremony – The passage says this will be in Beijing.\n6. Option 2: Events at Taizicheng Ski Resort – The passage says this is in Zhangjiakou, not Beijing.\n7. Option 3: Closing ceremony – The passage says this will be in Beijing.\n8. Option 4: Indoor ice events – The passage says these will be in Beijing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the event at Taizicheng Ski Resort, which is not in Beijing.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the similarities and differences between virtual teams and traditional teams.\n2. It states that \"バーチャルチームは、従来のチームと同じ水準の卓越性が求められますが、微妙な違いがあります。\" This means \"Virtual teams are required to achieve the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.\"\n3. The passage then describes some differences: virtual team members often act as liaisons for their physical groups, may have to schedule meetings across time zones, and tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members.\n4. It also mentions the concept of the \"invisible team\" (management), which is a unique element of virtual teams.\n5. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Both teams are required to achieve the same level of performance. This is directly stated in the passage.\n   - Option 2: Both teams have various levels of autonomy in daily routines. The passage says virtual teams tend to have more autonomy, implying a difference, not a similarity.\n   - Option 3: Both teams are under the supervision of invisible management. The passage says the \"invisible team\" is unique to virtual teams.\n   - Option 4: Both teams operate in the same time zone. The passage says virtual teams may have to adjust for time zones, which is a difference.\n\nTherefore, the only correct similarity according to the passage is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes traditional medieval castles and how they capture people's imagination.\n2. It mentions \"馬上槍試合\" (jousting), \"酒宴\" (banquets), and \"アーサー王の騎士\" (Knights of King Arthur).\n3. It also describes the ruins, the sounds of battles, the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, and the \"地下牢の穴\" (dungeon holes).\n4. The passage then questions whether our imagination is based on reality and asks why castles were built and how they were designed.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. 地下牢の穴 (dungeon holes) — This is mentioned in the passage.\n2. 馬上槍試合 (jousting) — This is mentioned in the passage.\n3. 騎士道 (chivalry) — The passage mentions \"アーサー王の騎士\" (Knights of King Arthur), which evokes the idea of chivalry, but the word \"chivalry\" itself is not directly mentioned.\n4. 騎士団 (knightly order) — The passage mentions \"Knights of King Arthur,\" but not \"knightly order\" (騎士団) as an organization or group.\n\nThe key is to find which one is NOT mentioned. \"騎士道\" (chivalry) is an abstract concept, and while the passage evokes the image of knights, it does not mention \"chivalry\" directly. However, \"騎士団\" (knightly order) refers to an organized group of knights, which is not mentioned at all; only individual knights are referenced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses Indonesian cuisine, which includes a wide variety of regional dishes from across the country's many islands.\n2. When the term \"Indonesian cuisine\" is used without further specification, it often refers to the cuisine from central to eastern Java.\n3. Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by simple seasoning.\n4. The main seasonings mentioned are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (specifically \"Java's coconut sugar\"), and various spices.\n\nNow, let's look at the question and options:\n\nQuestion: What is overwhelmingly used in Javanese cuisine among the following?\n\nOptions:\n1. White sugar\n2. Powdered sugar\n3. Coconut sugar\n4. Brown sugar\n\nFrom the passage, it specifically mentions \"ジャワのココナッツシュガー\" which translates to \"Java's coconut sugar\" as a main seasoning. This directly matches option 3, \"ココナッツシュガー\" (coconut sugar). The other types of sugar (white, powdered, brown) are not specifically mentioned as being characteristic of Javanese cuisine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step 1: Analyze the passage.\nThe passage describes a situation where passengers were waiting in the heat (over 90 degrees Fahrenheit) and were given water. It mentions that it was a very hot day in Santa Clara, and that being trapped on a roller coaster is uncomfortable regardless of the duration. It specifically says that it took over an hour for the first person to get off. The person making these comments is identified as \"消防隊のスコット・クーンズ隊長\" (Fire Department Captain Scott Coons).\n\nStep 2: Understand the question.\nThe question asks: According to the passage, who commented on the level of uncomfortable heat?\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options.\n1. 乗り物の操作係 (Ride operator)\n2. 消防隊長 (Fire Department Captain)\n3. 乗客 (Passenger)\n4. 警察署長 (Police Chief)\n\nStep 4: Match the passage to the options.\nThe passage attributes the comment about the heat and discomfort to \"消防隊のスコット・クーンズ隊長\" (Fire Department Captain Scott Coons), which matches option 2.\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains why stars emit light and heat.\n2. It states that the cause is hydrogen atoms fusing (combining) to form heavier elements, and this process releases energy.\n3. The passage also mentions that scientists are trying to develop reactors that can produce energy in the same way, but it is difficult and will take many years.\n4. The question asks: According to the passage, what does fusion allow stars to do?\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Formation of heavy elements. The passage does mention that fusion creates heavier elements from hydrogen.\n   - Option 2: Construction of fusion reactors. The passage says scientists are trying to do this, but it is not something fusion allows stars to do.\n   - Option 3: Emission of light and heat. The passage says the reason stars emit light and heat is because of the energy produced by fusion.\n   - Option 4: Creation of hydrogen atoms. The passage says hydrogen atoms are used up in fusion, not created.\n\n6. The question is asking what fusion allows stars to do. While fusion does create heavier elements (option 1), the main point of the passage is that this process releases energy, which allows stars to emit light and heat (option 3).\n\n7. Therefore, the best answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains the traditional path for royal heirs: after graduating from school, they usually enter the military.\n2. However, Charles did something different: he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, studied anthropology and archaeology, later studied history, and obtained a 2:2 degree.\n3. The key sentence is: \"チャールズは英国王室で初めて学位を取得した人物です。\" This means \"Charles was the first person in the British royal family to obtain a degree.\"\n4. Now, let's look at the options:\n   - 1. Entering the military before graduating school: The passage says the traditional path is to enter the military after school, not before, and Charles did not do this.\n   - 2. Studying archaeology: The passage says he studied archaeology, but it does not say he was the first to do so.\n   - 3. Obtaining a degree: The passage explicitly says Charles was the first in the royal family to obtain a degree.\n   - 4. Entering Trinity College: The passage does not say he was the first royal to enter Trinity College.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains that \"scaffolding\" is not a method of learning itself, but rather support provided to people engaging in new learning experiences, such as using new computer programs or starting new projects. Scaffolding can be both virtual (like software helpers) and real (like teachers).\n2. Examples of scaffolding given in the passage include teachers and the Microsoft Office paperclip assistant, both of which provide support, instructions, or explanations to help learners with tasks that might be difficult to do alone.\n3. Now, let's analyze each option:\n   - Option 1: \"コンピューターゲーム開始時のチュートリアル\" (A tutorial at the start of a computer game) — This is a virtual form of scaffolding, as it provides instructions and support to help the player learn the game.\n   - Option 2: \"SATの指導教員\" (An SAT tutor) — This is a real-life form of scaffolding, as the tutor supports the student in learning.\n   - Option 3: \"独学プログラム\" (A self-study program) — This implies learning alone, without external support or guidance. This is NOT scaffolding, as scaffolding requires some form of support.\n   - Option 4: \"リトルリーグのコーチ\" (A Little League coach) — This is a real-life form of scaffolding, as the coach supports and guides the players.\n\n4. Therefore, the only option that is NOT an example of scaffolding is option 3, the self-study program, because it lacks the supportive element described in the passage.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains what an \"おもてなし交流ネットワーク\" (hospitality exchange network) is. It says it is an organization that connects local people and travelers in cities that travelers visit.\n2. To participate, you usually fill out an online application, and sometimes additional verification is needed.\n3. Lists of available accommodations are provided in print or online, and sometimes include reviews and opinions from other travelers.\n4. The passage gives the example of Couchsurfing, which was started by Casey Fenton after he found a cheap ticket to Iceland but couldn't find a place to stay. He emailed local university students and received many offers for free accommodation.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"What is provided to tourists through the hospitality exchange network?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. ローカルホストが提供する宿泊施設 (Accommodation provided by local hosts) — This matches the passage, which talks about connecting travelers with locals who offer places to stay.\n2. 格安航空券 (Cheap airline tickets) — The passage mentions cheap tickets as Casey Fenton's motivation, but the network itself does not provide airline tickets.\n3. 地元ガイドによるツアー (Tours by local guides) — The passage does not mention tours.\n4. 同じ目的地を訪れる旅行者との繋がり (Connections with other travelers visiting the same destination) — The passage focuses on connecting travelers with locals, not with other travelers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "First, let's analyze the passage. The passage explains different types of tourism. It says that the most common form is \"観光レクリエーション\" (recreational tourism), where people go to places like beaches, theme parks, and campsites to relax and have fun. Then, it mentions that if the purpose of visiting a place is to learn about its history or culture, this type of tourism is called \"文化観光\" (cultural tourism). \n\nThe question asks: \"Visiting a museum, which type of tourism does it belong to?\" \n\nVisiting a museum is typically for learning about history or culture, not just for relaxation or outdoor activities. According to the passage, this matches the definition of \"文化観光\" (cultural tourism).\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Business tourism\n2. Recreational tourism\n3. Cultural tourism\n4. Outdoor tourism\n\nThe correct answer is \"cultural tourism,\" which is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses \"re-entry shock\" (再入国ショック), which is the difficulty people experience when returning to their home country after living abroad.\n2. It says that re-entry shock can come earlier, last longer, and be more severe than culture shock experienced when first going abroad.\n3. Even travelers who easily adapted to the new culture (\"新しい文化に易々と馴染めた旅行者も\") may struggle to readapt to their home culture.\n4. The passage explains that after adapting to a new culture, people may lose some habits of their home culture.\n5. When people travel abroad for the first time, those around them are patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need time to adjust.\n6. However, when returning home, people may not expect the traveler to need patience and understanding.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"According to the passage, what type of traveler finds it especially difficult to endure re-entry shock?\"\n\nOption analysis:\n1. Travelers who especially experienced bad culture shock — The passage does not mention this group as being especially affected by re-entry shock.\n2. Travelers who quickly adapted during their overseas life — The passage specifically says that even those who easily adapted to the new culture may have trouble readapting to their home culture.\n3. Travelers who are still in the honeymoon phase — The passage mentions \"新婚旅行の時期が少ない\" (the honeymoon period is short), but this is in reference to culture shock, not re-entry shock.\n4. Travelers with weak patience — The passage does not mention this as a specific group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, as the passage directly states that even those who adapted easily to the new culture may struggle with re-entry shock.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.\n2. It mentions that if you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that comes back to you, you should prepare a boomerang suitable for returning.\n3. It also states that most boomerangs available in Australia actually do not come back.\n4. For beginners, it is advised not to throw in windy places.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"If thrown correctly, it always returns to your hand.\"  \n   - The passage does not say that all boomerangs always return if thrown correctly. In fact, it says most boomerangs do not return.\n\n2. \"It is more popular among locals than tourists.\"  \n   - The passage says it is popular among tourists, not locals.\n\n3. \"There are not many boomerangs available in Australia.\"  \n   - The passage says most boomerangs in Australia do not return, not that there are few boomerangs.\n\n4. \"Only some boomerangs can return.\"  \n   - This matches the passage, which says only boomerangs suitable for returning will come back, and most do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a rugby match held at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa, where South Africa (the Springboks) defeated New Zealand (the All Blacks) by a score of 21-20.\n2. The All Blacks' 15-match winning streak ended, and the Springboks ended a 5-match losing streak.\n3. The match was the All Blacks' last match, as they had already won the trophy two weeks earlier.\n4. The passage then says: \"The final match of the series will be next week, where the Springboks will play Australia at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Which teams will play at Ellis Park?\"\n\nOptions:\n1. All Blacks and Australia\n2. New Zealand and South Africa\n3. South Africa and Australia\n4. Springboks and All Blacks\n\nFrom the passage, it is clear that the final match at Ellis Park will be between the Springboks (South Africa) and Australia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains two types of bowing marks for string instruments: \"上げ弓\" (up-bow) and \"下げ弓\" (down-bow).\n2. The up-bow mark looks like a \"V\", and the down-bow mark looks like a staple or a rectangle with the bottom missing.\n3. \"アップ\" (up-bow) starts from the tip and pushes the bow, producing a softer sound.\n4. \"ダウン\" (down-bow) starts from the frog (the part of the bow held by the hand) and pulls the bow, producing a stronger, more assertive sound.\n5. The passage also mentions that you can write these marks freely, but printed bowing marks have musical reasons and should usually be followed.\n\nNow, the question asks: \"According to the passage, which of the following is NOT related to pulling the bow (弓を引くこと)?\"\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. やわらかい音 (soft sound)  \n   - The passage says up-bow (pushing from the tip) produces a soft sound. Up-bow is not pulling the bow; it's pushing. So, soft sound is NOT related to pulling the bow.\n\n2. ホチキスの針のようなマーク (staple-like mark)  \n   - The passage says the down-bow mark looks like a staple, and down-bow is pulling the bow. So, this IS related to pulling the bow.\n\n3. より強い音 (stronger sound)  \n   - The passage says down-bow (pulling from the frog) produces a stronger sound. So, this IS related to pulling the bow.\n\n4. フロッグかたの開始 (starting from the frog)  \n   - The passage says down-bow starts from the frog, which is pulling the bow. So, this IS related to pulling the bow.\n\nTherefore, the only option NOT related to pulling the bow is option 1 (soft sound).\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the swearing-in of a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with 9 members, and that this is the fifth CEP for Martelly in four years.\n2. It mentions that last month, the \"大統領委員会\" (presidential commission) recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country toward new elections.\n3. The passage further explains that this commission was a response by President Martelly to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.\n4. The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold scheduled elections since 2011.\n\nNow, the question asks: \"Who proposed the resignation of the previous CEP?\"\n\nLet's look at the options:\n1. Martelly\n2. Protesters\n3. Presidential commission\n4. CEP members themselves\n\nFrom the passage, it is clear that the \"大統領委員会\" (presidential commission) recommended the resignation of the previous CEP. This matches option 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes an outbreak of a disease that is first reported in late July. The disease is carried by pigs and then transmitted to humans by mosquitoes.\n2. In response, the Indian government took several measures: deploying pig catchers to affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, spraying insecticides, and promising millions of encephalitis vaccines.\n3. The passage specifically mentions that the plan was to deliver vaccines to the most historically affected areas this year, but this was delayed due to lack of funds and lower priority compared to other diseases.\n4. The question asks: \"Based on the passage, which preventive measure is implemented last?\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Insecticides (殺虫剤) – These were already being sprayed as part of the immediate response.\n2. Pig catchers (豚捕獲者) – These were also deployed early on.\n3. Encephalitis vaccine (脳炎ワクチン) – The passage says the government promised millions of vaccines, but the actual delivery was delayed and planned for the future.\n4. Mosquito nets (蚊帳) – These were distributed as part of the immediate response.\n\nFrom the passage, the only measure that is explicitly stated as being delayed and planned for the future is the vaccine. The other measures were already being implemented.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that nutrition therapy alone does not make a top athlete, but nutritional intake can greatly affect the overall health of young athletes.\n2. It mentions three specific things:\n   - Maintaining a healthy energy balance\n   - Practicing effective hydration habits\n   - Understanding various practical aspects of supplements\n3. It also says that these practices help both improve athlete performance and promote sports in general.\n\nNow, let's look at the question:  \nWhich of the following is NOT recommended in the passage as a way for young athletes to enjoy sports more?\n\nLet's check each option:\n1. Practicing appropriate nutritional intake — This is recommended in the passage.\n2. Maintaining top-level performance — The passage does not say young athletes should maintain \"top-level\" or \"elite\" performance; it only mentions improving performance and health, not being at the highest level.\n3. Effective hydration — This is recommended in the passage.\n4. Maintaining a healthy energy balance — This is also recommended in the passage.\n\nOption 2 is not recommended in the passage as a way for young athletes to enjoy sports more; the passage does not mention maintaining elite-level performance as a recommendation.\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the transition from a quarter marathon to a half marathon.\n2. It states that in a half marathon, speed becomes much less important, and endurance (持久力) is absolutely necessary.\n3. It acknowledges that top half marathon runners who can run under 2 minutes must have some speed, but regardless, they must improve their endurance.\n4. It suggests that running cross-country in winter and training the upper body at the gym are good preparations for the running season.\n\nNow, let's look at the question:  \nAccording to the passage, what is the most important thing for a top half marathon runner?\n\nOption analysis:\n1. Running cross-country in winter – This is suggested as good preparation, but not stated as the most important thing.\n2. Building endurance rather than speed – The passage emphasizes that endurance is absolutely necessary and more important than speed.\n3. Achieving a time under 2 minutes – This is mentioned as something top runners do, but not as the most important thing.\n4. Increasing speed rather than endurance – The passage says the opposite; endurance is more important than speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the difficulty primates with human-like digestive systems have in obtaining essential amino acids from plant resources available in the savanna.\n2. It states that failing to obtain these amino acids leads to serious consequences like growth suppression, malnutrition, and even death.\n3. The most accessible plant resources are leaves and beans, but the proteins in these are hard to digest for primates unless cooked.\n4. In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide all essential amino acids, making them a high-quality protein source.\n5. The passage concludes that it is not surprising if our ancestors solved the \"protein problem\" in the same way as modern chimpanzees in the savanna.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. 枯れ葉 (dead leaves): The passage says leaves are hard to digest and does not mention dead leaves as a good source.\n2. 生の豆類 (raw beans): The passage says beans are hard to digest unless cooked.\n3. バッタ類 (grasshoppers): While not specifically mentioned, grasshoppers are animal-based food, similar to ants and termites, which the passage says are good sources of protein and essential amino acids.\n4. 花の茎 (flower stems): Not mentioned as a protein source.\n\nBased on the passage, the best answer is the animal-based food, which in the options is grasshoppers.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains that when you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, the call is automatically routed via a satellite.\n2. It says that artificial satellites in space receive the call and reflect (relay) it almost instantly.\n3. The passage also mentions that satellites are sent into space by rockets.\n4. It then discusses why scientists use telescopes in space (because Earth's atmosphere distorts light and views).\n5. Finally, it says that to launch satellites and telescopes into space, you need a huge rocket.\n\nNow, let's look at the question:  \n\"Which of the following reflects (relays) long-distance phone calls to Earth?\"\n\nOptions:\n1. Telescope (望遠鏡) – The passage says telescopes are used for observing, not for relaying phone calls.\n2. Artificial satellite (人工衛星) – The passage clearly states that satellites receive and relay phone calls.\n3. Light (光) – Light is mentioned in the context of telescopes and vision, not phone calls.\n4. Rocket (ロケット) – Rockets are used to launch satellites and telescopes, not to relay phone calls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the gravity on Io (イオ), one of Jupiter's moons, and compares it to Earth's gravity.\n2. It states that if a person stands on Io, their weight would be less than on Earth. For example, a person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io.\n3. The passage concludes that gravity is weaker (lighter) on Io than on Earth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"地球の重力はイオの重力よりもかからない\" — This means \"Earth's gravity is less than Io's gravity.\" This is incorrect, as the passage says Earth's gravity is stronger.\n2. \"イオの重力はもっとかかるので、体重が軽くなる\" — This means \"Io's gravity is stronger, so weight becomes lighter.\" This is contradictory; if gravity is stronger, weight would be heavier, not lighter.\n3. \"イオの重力はもっとかかるので、体重が重くなる\" — This means \"Io's gravity is stronger, so weight becomes heavier.\" This is also incorrect; the passage says weight becomes lighter on Io.\n4. \"地球の重力はイオの重力よりもかかる\" — This means \"Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's gravity.\" This matches the passage's content.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes an incident where a photographer was transported to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and later died. He was reported to be in his 20s.\n2. Justin Bieber made a statement saying he was not at the scene and was not directly involved in the tragic accident, but he is praying for the victim's family.\n3. According to TMZ, the photographer parked his car on the opposite side of Sepulveda Boulevard and tried to take pictures of a police checkpoint before crossing the road.\n4. The California Highway Patrol officers, who were controlling traffic, ordered the photographer twice to go back before he crossed.\n5. The police say it is unlikely that the driver who hit the photographer will be criminally charged.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"What was the photographer trying to do before being hit by the car?\"\n\nOption analysis:\n1. \"Park his car on Sepulveda Boulevard\" – The passage says he parked his car, but this was before the main action.\n2. \"Take pictures of the police checkpoint\" – The passage specifically says he tried to take pictures of the police checkpoint before crossing the road.\n3. \"Cross a busy street\" – He did cross the street, but the passage emphasizes his intent to take pictures.\n4. \"Persuade the police officer to let him keep taking pictures\" – There is no mention of him trying to persuade the police.\n\nThe most accurate answer, based on the passage, is option 2: He was trying to take pictures of the police checkpoint before being hit.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, has issued a warning that \"Somali extremists\" are planning suicide bombings in Kenya and Ethiopia.\n2. The US has received information from confidential sources specifically mentioning the use of suicide bombings to blow up \"prominent landmarks\" in Ethiopia and Kenya.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: Which statement most accurately describes the attack plan claimed by the extremists?\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"Blow up a landmark in one country\" — This is too limited; the passage mentions two countries.\n2. \"Blow up bombs in two countries\" — This is closer, but it doesn't specify that the targets are landmarks.\n3. \"Blow up bombs at landmarks in two countries\" — This matches the passage: two countries (Kenya and Ethiopia), and the targets are \"prominent landmarks.\"\n4. \"Blow up bombs in one country\" — This is incorrect; the passage mentions two countries.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes Kirby Muxloe Castle as a typical castle of its era, but it feels more like a fortified residence than a true fortress.\n2. It mentions that the castle has large glass windows and thin walls, which would not have withstood a prolonged, determined attack.\n3. The construction began in the 1480s by Lord Hastings, during a relatively peaceful time in the country.\n4. The only defense needed was against small groups of wandering raiders, not large-scale attacks.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"The thick walls of the castle were at the request of Lord Hastings.\"  \n   - The passage says the walls were thin, not thick, so this is incorrect.\n\n2. \"Because the era in which it was built was characterized by a peace-loving country, only minimal fortification was necessary.\"  \n   - This matches the passage: the country was relatively peaceful, and only minimal defense was needed.\n\n3. \"The structure of this castle was not typical for its era.\"  \n   - The passage says it was a typical castle of its era, so this is incorrect.\n\n4. \"It was built to withstand prolonged, fierce attacks.\"  \n   - The passage says it would not have withstood such attacks, so this is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions that the Komen Foundation (コメン財団) has adopted a new rule: they will not provide grants or funding to organizations under legal investigation.\n2. The spokesperson, Leslie Aun, says that because the Family Planning Federation of America (米国家族計画連盟) is under investigation, they are now ineligible for funding.\n3. The investigation is being conducted by Representative Cliff Stearns, who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (監視・調査小委員会), which is under the House Energy and Commerce Committee (エネルギー商業対策委員会).\n4. The investigation is about whether taxpayer money is being used for abortions through the Family Planning Federation.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Which organization is under legal investigation?\"\n\nOption analysis:\n1. エネルギー商業対策委員会 (House Energy and Commerce Committee) — This is the committee conducting the investigation, not being investigated.\n2. コメン財団 (Komen Foundation) — They are making the funding decision, not being investigated.\n3. 家族計画連盟 (Family Planning Federation) — The passage says they are under investigation.\n4. 監視・調査小委員会 (Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations) — This is the subcommittee conducting the investigation, not being investigated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses what parts of the cycad plant (ソテツ) Triceratops might have eaten.\n2. It mentions that Triceratops could crush not only leaves but also hard branches and roots with its teeth.\n3. Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads, which have sharp, crown-shaped leaves and look like palm shrubs.\n4. The passage says Triceratops may have used its strong beak to strip the leaves before eating the trunk.\n5. However, other scientists argue that these plants are highly toxic, and it's unlikely any dinosaur ate them, even though some modern animals can eat toxic leaves or fruit.\n6. The question asks which part of the cycad Triceratops was most likely to eat, according to the passage.\n7. The passage specifically mentions that Triceratops may have stripped the leaves before eating the trunk, but the main focus is on the leaves, as that's what is discussed in relation to its beak and feeding behavior.\n8. The other options (trunk, root, fruit) are mentioned less directly or not at all as likely food sources.\n\nAnswer:\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes Goma as a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda, in the far east.\n2. In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the streets, especially in the city center, were buried.\n3. Goma is considered fairly safe, but if you visit places outside Goma, you need to check and understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.\n4. The city is a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and is one of the cheapest places in Africa to track mountain gorillas.\n5. For getting around Goma, you can use \"boda boda\" (motorbike taxis), and the usual local fare for a short distance is about 500 Congolese francs.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Which of the following is NOT good advice for tourists in Goma?\"\n\nOption analysis:\n1. \"北キブの戦闘は面白い\" — \"The fighting in North Kivu is interesting.\"  \n   The passage warns tourists to check and understand the fighting situation in North Kivu, implying it is dangerous, not interesting. Advising tourists that the fighting is \"interesting\" is NOT good advice.\n\n2. \"低価格なマウンテンゴリラ追跡には良い場所である\" — \"It is a good place for low-cost mountain gorilla tracking.\"  \n   The passage says Goma is one of the cheapest places in Africa for this, so this is good advice.\n\n3. \"バイクタクシーはあちこち移動するのに良い手段だ\" — \"Motorbike taxis are a good way to get around.\"  \n   The passage says you can use boda boda for getting around, so this is good advice.\n\n4. \"ニラゴンゴ火山の拠点は街中にある\" — \"The base for Nyiragongo volcano is in the city.\"  \n   The passage says Goma is the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, so this is good advice.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is NOT good advice is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses ways to travel cheaply, focusing on reducing expenses rather than working while traveling.\n2. It mentions that to get expenses close to zero, one must sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability.\n3. The advice assumes travelers do not exploit others or engage in illegal activities.\n4. The question asks: According to the passage, what kind of person would struggle to travel on a very small budget?\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Someone who likes to challenge themselves with difficult tasks.\n2. Someone without strict time constraints.\n3. Someone planning to do remote work while traveling.\n4. Someone who enjoys following an itinerary.\n\nNow, let's match these to the passage:\n\n- The passage says that traveling on a minimal budget requires sacrificing comfort, time, and predictability. If someone enjoys following an itinerary (which implies predictability and structure), they would struggle because minimal-budget travel lacks predictability and comfort.\n- Option 4 matches this: \"Someone who enjoys following an itinerary.\"\n- Option 1 (challenging oneself) is not necessarily a problem; in fact, such people might enjoy the challenge.\n- Option 2 (no strict time constraints) would actually help, since minimal-budget travel requires flexibility.\n- Option 3 (planning to do remote work) is not relevant, as the passage focuses on those not working while traveling.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the differences between French spoken in Belgium/Switzerland and in France.\n2. It says that while the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is a little different from that in France, they are mutually understandable.\n3. Specifically, it mentions that the \"number system\" (番号体系) in Belgian and Swiss French is somewhat special and different from that in France.\n4. It also notes that the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.\n5. However, it says that all Belgians and Swiss who speak French have learned standard French at school, so they can understand the standard French number system.\n6. Now, let's look at the options:\n   - 1. \"All word pronunciations\" — The passage says only some pronunciations are different, not all.\n   - 2. \"Number system\" — The passage specifically says the number system is different.\n   - 3. \"Standard French taught at school\" — The passage says they all learn standard French at school, so this is not a difference.\n   - 4. \"Spelling of some French words\" — The passage does not mention spelling differences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions that according to the US Geological Survey's international earthquake map, no earthquakes were recorded in Iceland in the previous week.\n2. The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported no seismic activity in the Hekla region in the past 48 hours.\n3. It then says that significant seismic activity leading to a phase change occurred on the northeast side of the volcano's summit caldera on March 10.\n4. There is mention of dark clouds unrelated to volcanic activity, which can make it difficult to determine if an eruption actually occurred.\n\nNow, the question asks: \"According to the passage, when did the phase change occur?\"\n\nLet's look at the options:\n1. Before March 10\n2. The past 48 hours\n3. March 10\n4. One week ago\n\nFrom the passage, the only specific date given for the phase change is March 10. The other time frames (past 48 hours, previous week) are mentioned as periods with no seismic activity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the concept of time, noting that it is a familiar yet difficult-to-understand concept that affects all our activities.\n2. It mentions that religious figures, philosophers, and scientists have studied time for thousands of years.\n3. The passage explains that we experience time as a sequence of events from the future, through the present, to the past.\n4. It also says that time can be understood as a way to compare the duration (length) of events.\n5. Importantly, the passage states that by observing the repetition of periodic events, we can use them as markers to track the passage of time. It defines periodic events as those that occur repeatedly and regularly.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"When tracking the passage of time, what should we pay attention to regarding periodic events?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. 継続時間 (duration) – This refers to the length of time an event lasts.\n2. 繰り返し (repetition) – This refers to the fact that the event happens repeatedly.\n3. 影響 (influence) – This refers to the effect or impact of the event.\n4. 障害 (obstacle) – This refers to obstacles or hindrances.\n\nThe passage specifically says that by observing the repetition of periodic events, we can use them as markers for the passage of time. It defines periodic events as those that occur repeatedly and regularly. Therefore, the key point to pay attention to is the \"repetition\" of these events.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage mentions that the document refers to the border dispute, specifically that Palestine's hope is based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war. This means the document includes the issue of border disputes.\n2. It also says that the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley are reported to be addressed in the document. So, the future of Jerusalem is included.\n3. The passage further explains that Israel demands a 10-year continued military presence in the valley if the agreement is made, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to only 5 years. This means the issue of military presence in the valley is included.\n4. However, the passage does not mention anything about the causes of the 1967 war; it only refers to the borders before the war.\n\nNow, let's match the options:\n1. The future of Jerusalem – included in the document.\n2. The causes of the 1967 war – NOT included in the document.\n3. Military presence in the valley – included in the document.\n4. Border dispute – included in the document.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that Martelly was sworn in with a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of 9 members. This is his fifth CEP in four years.\n2. Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures to move the country toward new elections.\n3. The creation of this new committee was a response by President Martelly to widespread opposition protests that began in October.\n4. These protests, which sometimes became violent, were triggered by the failure to hold scheduled elections since 2011.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. \"大統領委員会は抗議行動への対策だった\"  \n   Translation: The presidential commission was a response to the protests.  \n   The passage says the committee was created as a response to the protests. This is correct.\n\n2. \"長らく延期された選挙が抗議行動の引き金なった\"  \n   Translation: The long-postponed elections triggered the protests.  \n   The passage says the protests were triggered by the failure to hold scheduled elections since 2011. This is correct.\n\n3. \"抗議行動は前CEP辞任を要求した\"  \n   Translation: The protests demanded the resignation of the previous CEP.  \n   The passage says the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of measures for new elections, but it does not say the protests specifically demanded the resignation of the previous CEP. This is not supported by the passage.\n\n4. \"抗議行動は時に暴力的だった\"  \n   Translation: The protests were sometimes violent.  \n   The passage says the protests sometimes became violent. This is correct.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT correct according to the passage is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's break down the passage:\n\n- Johnny Reid, the co-driver for the A1GP New Zealand team, drove across the Auckland Harbour Bridge at high speed, making history.\n- He drove the \"Black Beauty\" A1GP car across the bridge 7 times at speeds over 160 km/h.\n- The New Zealand police had trouble measuring his speed with their speed gun because the car was too fast.\n- The police were only able to confirm his speed when he slowed down to 160 km/h.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question and options:\n\nQuestion: When were the police able to use their speed gun to measure Johnny Reid's driving speed?\n\nOption 1: While he was driving at 160 km/h.\nOption 2: When he crossed the bridge for the 7th time.\nOption 3: While he was driving over 160 km/h.\nOption 4: When he crossed the bridge for the first time.\n\nFrom the passage, the key sentence is: \"警察がリード氏の速度を確認できたのは、時速160 kmまで減速したときだけだったそうです。\"  \nTranslation: \"The police were only able to confirm his speed when he slowed down to 160 km/h.\"\n\nSo, the correct answer is when he was driving at 160 km/h, which matches option 1.\n\nOption 2 and 4 are about the number of times he crossed the bridge, which is not relevant to when the police could measure his speed.  \nOption 3 says \"while he was driving over 160 km/h,\" but the passage says the police could NOT measure his speed at that time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains that curry is a dish made by simmering meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.\n2. It mentions that curries are classified as \"dry\" or \"wet\" depending on the amount of liquid.\n3. It then states: \"In inland areas of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry, while in coastal areas of South India and the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"In certain regions, coconut milk is sometimes used instead of which curry ingredient?\"\n\nThe key information is that in inland areas, yogurt is used, and in coastal areas, coconut milk is used. This suggests that coconut milk is used in place of yogurt in those regions.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n1. Meat\n2. Vegetables\n3. Yogurt\n4. Spices\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answer is \"yogurt.\"\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a region bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west. It gives advice specifically for female travelers.\n2. The advice includes: \n   - Female travelers should declare themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.\n   - Wearing a ring (not an expensive-looking one) is effective.\n   - Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to behaviors that may be considered harassment, such as being followed or having their arm grabbed, which are not uncommon.\n   - When refusing advances from men, women should be firm and not hesitate to maintain their position, regardless of cultural differences.\n3. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Recognize that being followed is rare.\" This is incorrect; the passage says being followed is not uncommon.\n   - Option 2: \"Wear a large ring to show you are married.\" The passage says to wear a ring, but specifically says not to wear one that looks expensive, and does not specify \"large.\"\n   - Option 3: \"Understand that cultural differences suggest you should avoid maintaining your position.\" This is the opposite of the passage's advice; it says to be firm regardless of cultural differences.\n   - Option 4: \"Firmly refuse unwanted advances from men.\" This matches the passage's advice to be firm and not hesitate to maintain your position.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the events following the adoption of a document (likely the Declaration of Independence) on July 4.\n2. After being signed by John Hancock and Charles Thomson, the handwritten draft was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap (ダンラップ社の印刷所), where 150-200 copies were made overnight. These are called the \"Dunlap Broadsides\" (ダンラップ・ブロードサイド).\n3. The first public reading of this document was on July 8 at Independence Hall (独立記念館).\n4. One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to troops in New York (ニューヨーク) on July 9.\n5. Another copy arrived in London (ロンドン) on August 10.\n6. The passage notes that 25 copies are known to exist today, and the original handwritten draft does not survive.\n\nNow, the question asks: \"Of the following places, where did the Dunlap Broadside ultimately arrive?\"\n\nLet's look at the options:\n1. New York (ニューヨーク) – A copy was read to troops there on July 9.\n2. Dunlap's printing shop (ダンラップ社の印刷所) – This is where the broadsides were printed, not where they ultimately arrived.\n3. London (ロンドン) – A copy arrived there on August 10, which is the latest date mentioned in the passage.\n4. Independence Hall (独立記念館) – The first public reading was here on July 8.\n\nThe key word is \"ultimately\" (最終的に), meaning the final destination among the options. The passage gives the latest date for London (August 10), which is after the other events. Therefore, the Dunlap Broadside ultimately arrived in London.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the main ingredients of cuisine from Mallorca (マヨルカ島).\n2. It states that, similar to other Mediterranean regions, the main ingredients are bread (パン), vegetables (野菜), and meat (especially pork, 肉（特に豚肉）), and that olive oil is used a lot.\n3. It also mentions a popular summer dish called \"pan boli\" (パンボリ), which uses bread, tomato, cheese, and seasonings like tuna.\n4. The question asks: According to the passage, which of the following is NOT a main ingredient in Mallorcan cuisine?\n5. The options are:\n   1. Meat (肉)\n   2. Bread (パン)\n   3. Grains (穀物)\n   4. Vegetables (野菜)\n6. Reviewing the passage, \"meat,\" \"bread,\" and \"vegetables\" are all explicitly mentioned as main ingredients.\n7. \"Grains\" (穀物) are not mentioned at all in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains that avalanches are not abnormal phenomena. There is a limit to the amount of snow that can be supported on a steep slope, and any excess falls as an avalanche.\n2. The passage mentions that because snow is sticky (has adhesiveness), some kind of trigger is needed for it to fall.\n3. It further explains that part of the falling snow can trigger the rest to fall.\n4. The passage then lists possible triggers for avalanches: melting of snow due to the sun's heat, increase in snowfall, other natural phenomena, and sometimes human factors.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Sticky snow (粘着性がある雪) – The passage says this is why a trigger is needed, not a trigger itself.\n2. Humans (人間) – The passage says human factors can be a trigger.\n3. Sunlight (日光) – The passage says melting due to the sun's heat can be a trigger.\n4. Additional snowfall (追加の降雪) – The passage says increase in snowfall can be a trigger.\n\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following can be a trigger for an avalanche?\" According to the passage, options 2, 3, and 4 are all triggers, but option 1 is not (it's the reason a trigger is needed).\n\nSince the question asks for \"which one,\" and the options are mutually exclusive, the best answer is one of the triggers. Let's check the Japanese wording for each:\n\n2. 人間 (humans) – matches \"人為的な要因\" (human factors)\n3. 日光 (sunlight) – matches \"太陽の熱による雪解け\" (melting due to the sun's heat)\n4. 追加の降雪 (additional snowfall) – matches \"降雪量の増加\" (increase in snowfall)\n\nAll three are correct, but since the question asks for \"which one,\" and usually in such questions, the first correct trigger listed in the passage is the sun's heat (日光), but the passage also says \"increase in snowfall\" and \"human factors\" are triggers.\n\nHowever, the most direct and general answer, based on the passage, is \"additional snowfall\" (option 4), as it is a clear and common trigger.\n\nFinal answer:\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage talks about famous Greek politicians, scientists, and artists.\n2. It mentions Homer (ホメロス), the legendary blind poet (伝説の盲目詩人), who composed the two great masterpieces of Greek literature: the Iliad and the Odyssey.\n3. The word \"盲目\" (moumoku) means \"blind.\"\n4. The question asks: \"What was the Greek poet Homer unable to do?\"\n5. The options are:\n   1. Hear (聞くこと)\n   2. See (見ること)\n   3. Walk (歩くこと)\n   4. Speak (しゃべること)\n6. Since the passage specifically describes Homer as a \"blind poet,\" the thing he could not do was \"see.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses airlines expanding routes to Africa and suggests comparing the total fare estimate for Africa-bound flights with round-the-world fares.\n2. It mentions that if you visit places other than Africa, you should not forget about additional costs such as extra visa applications, departure taxes, and ground transportation fees.\n3. The question asks: When comparing the total fare estimate for Africa-bound flights and round-the-world fares, which cost does NOT need to be added?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Additional visa fees for places other than Africa\" — The passage says you should not forget these if you visit places other than Africa, so these are additional costs to consider.\n   - Option 2: \"Departure tax fees for Africa\" — This is a cost directly related to Africa, so it should be included.\n   - Option 3: \"Visa fees for Africa\" — This is also directly related to Africa, so it should be included.\n   - Option 4: \"Ground transportation fees for places other than Africa\" — The passage says not to forget these if you visit places other than Africa, so these are additional costs to consider.\n\n5. The key is that when comparing the Africa-bound fare estimate and the round-the-world fare, you do NOT need to add costs that are not related to Africa. The passage specifically says to remember extra costs for non-African destinations, implying that for a simple Africa trip, you don't need to add those.\n\n6. The question is asking which cost does NOT need to be added. The only costs that do NOT need to be added when comparing Africa-only fares are those not related to Africa.\n\n7. Option 2, \"Departure tax fees for Africa,\" and Option 3, \"Visa fees for Africa,\" are necessary for the Africa trip. Option 1 and Option 4 are for non-African destinations.\n\n8. The correct answer is the cost that does NOT need to be added: \"Departure tax fees for Africa\" (Option 2) is necessary, so it's not the answer. \"Visa fees for Africa\" (Option 3) is also necessary. \"Additional visa fees for places other than Africa\" (Option 1) and \"Ground transportation fees for places other than Africa\" (Option 4) are not necessary unless you visit other places.\n\n9. The question is about what does NOT need to be added. The best answer is one of the costs for non-African destinations.\n\n10. Between Option 1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage quotes President Hu Jintao saying, \"We will strive to significantly reduce CO2 emissions per GDP by 2020 compared to 2005 levels.\"  \n   - This means he mentions a target date (2020) for the reduction.  \n   - He also mentions the basis for reduction: per GDP (economic output).\n\n2. The passage says Hu did not specify a numerical value for the reduction, but said the reduction would be based on economic output.\n\n3. Hu also called on developing countries to avoid the traditional approach of \"pollute first, clean up later.\"  \n   - This is advice to developing countries regarding pollution.\n\n4. He added that developing countries should not be asked to take on obligations beyond their stage of development, responsibility, or capability.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. 削減の基準 (The basis/standard for reduction)  \n   - He did mention this: reduction per GDP (economic output).\n\n2. 汚染に関する発展途上国への助言 (Advice to developing countries about pollution)  \n   - He did give advice: avoid \"pollute first, clean up later.\"\n\n3. 二酸化炭素排出量の削減を期待する期日 (The expected date for CO2 reduction)  \n   - He did mention the target year: by 2020.\n\n4. 二酸化炭素排出量削減の数値 (The numerical value of CO2 reduction)  \n   - The passage explicitly says he did NOT specify a numerical value.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes Babylonian temples and their structure.\n2. Each god had a main temple, considered the god's house.\n3. People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests performed rituals and festivals to fulfill the gods' wishes.\n4. Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary (内宮) that only priests could enter.\n5. Sometimes, a special pyramid-shaped tower called a ziggurat was built as part of the temple, with a special sanctuary for the god at the top.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"According to the passage, where would you not see ordinary Babylonian citizens?\"\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. 神殿の中庭で生贄を捧げる場 (The place in the temple courtyard where sacrifices are offered)\n   - The passage says people offered sacrifices, and the courtyard is open, so ordinary citizens could be here.\n\n2. 第一神殿で儀式を行う場 (The place in the main temple where rituals are performed)\n   - The passage says priests performed rituals, but it doesn't specify that ordinary people couldn't be present. However, it is less clear.\n\n3. 神殿の中庭での祭りの場 (The place in the temple courtyard where festivals are held)\n   - The passage says festivals were held, and the courtyard is open, so ordinary citizens could be here.\n\n4. 内宮で生贄を捧げる場 (The place in the inner sanctuary where sacrifices are offered)\n   - The passage clearly states that only priests could enter the inner sanctuary (内宮). Therefore, ordinary citizens would not be seen here.\n\nBased on the passage, the only place where ordinary citizens would not be seen is the inner sanctuary (内宮).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains what happens after using a light bulb for hundreds of hours.\n2. It says that eventually, the filament inside the bulb \"burns out\" (燃え尽きて), and the bulb stops lighting up (点灯しなくなります).\n3. The passage then discusses the need to replace the bulb and gives safety instructions for doing so, such as turning off the switch or unplugging the cable to avoid electric shock.\n4. The reason for the bulb not lighting up is clearly stated as the filament burning out.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. The switch not being turned off properly — This is about safety during replacement, not the cause of the bulb not lighting.\n2. The metal base of the bulb being only partially in the socket — This is not mentioned as a cause for the bulb not lighting.\n3. The filament inside the bulb burning out — This matches exactly what the passage says.\n4. The speed of the current flowing to the socket decreasing — This is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains the dress code for visiting a monastery. Women must wear skirts that cover the knees and cover their shoulders. Most monasteries provide coverings for women who come unprepared.\n2. Men must wear pants that cover the knees. These can also be borrowed at the entrance, but they are one-size and may not be washed after each use.\n3. The passage mentions that coverings (likely shawls or cloths) and pants are available to borrow at the entrance.\n4. The passage does not mention the availability of skirts for borrowing, but it does say coverings are available for women, which could include skirts or wraps.\n5. The passage does not mention the availability of shorts (短パン) for borrowing. In fact, shorts are not allowed, as men must wear pants that cover the knees.\n6. \"Cloth\" (布) is likely referring to the coverings provided for women, which are available.\n7. Therefore, the item that cannot be borrowed is \"shorts\" (短パン), as they are not appropriate attire and are not provided.\n\nAnswer:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a rugby tournament, mentioning that the match started at 10:00 AM and the weather was good for rugby.\n2. South Africa, the top seed, played against Zambia (the 5th seed) and won 26-00, showing a strong start.\n3. The passage says that South Africa \"looked rusty\" when playing against their southern sister country (Zambia), but \"as the tournament progressed, they steadily improved.\"\n4. Their disciplined defense, ball-handling skills, and teamwork were outstanding, making it clear they were the winners.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"According to the passage, when did South Africa's play begin to improve?\"\n\nOption analysis:\n1. \"Around 10:00 AM\" — The passage does not say their play improved specifically at this time.\n2. \"After they tightened their defense\" — While their defense is praised, the passage does not say improvement started after this.\n3. \"After losing to Zambia\" — They did not lose to Zambia; they won 26-00.\n4. \"As the tournament progressed\" — The passage explicitly says, \"as the tournament progressed, they steadily improved.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses two gene pools: hidden and expressed genetic variations.\n2. It mentions that \"新しい遺伝的変異が加わり\" (new genetic variations are added) by \"突然変異\" (mutations).\n3. It also says that selection removes variations from the expressed pool, and that \"棲み分けと組み換え\" (segregation and recombination) shuffle variations between the pools.\n4. The question asks: \"Which process is a factor in the addition of genetic variation?\"\n5. From the passage, the process that adds new genetic variation is \"突然変異\" (mutation).\n\nOption analysis:\n1. 分離 (segregation) – shuffles existing variation, does not add new.\n2. 組み換え (recombination) – shuffles existing variation, does not add new.\n3. 突然変異 (mutation) – creates new genetic variation.\n4. 発現 (expression) – refers to whether a gene is shown, not to adding variation.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says Bobek was born in Zagreb, Croatia, and became famous while playing for Partizan Belgrade.\n2. He joined Partizan in 1945 and stayed until 1958.\n3. During his time there, he played 468 matches and scored 403 goals.\n4. No other player has as many appearances or goals for the club.\n5. In 1995, he was chosen as the greatest player in Partizan's history.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. \"1945年にパルチザンでデビューした\" — This means \"He debuted at Partizan in 1945.\" The passage says he joined them in 1945, which matches this statement.\n2. \"パルチザンベオグラードの前にザグレブで活躍した\" — This means \"He was active in Zagreb before Partizan Belgrade.\" The passage only says he was born in Zagreb, not that he played there before Partizan.\n3. \"1995年までパルチザンで活躍した\" — This means \"He was active at Partizan until 1995.\" The passage says he stayed until 1958, not 1995.\n4. \"パルチザン最高選手に選ばれた後に有名になった\" — This means \"He became famous after being chosen as Partizan's greatest player.\" The passage says he became famous while playing for Partizan, not after 1995.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how children develop awareness of race and racial stereotypes from a very young age.\n2. It specifically mentions that these racial stereotypes influence behavior (\"こうした人種の固定観念が行動に影響を与えます\").\n3. An example is given: if a child identifies with a minority group that is stereotyped as not doing well in school, and the child becomes aware of this stereotype, the child is more likely to perform poorly in school.\n4. The question asks: According to the passage, which of the following can be influenced by a child's racial stereotypes?\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"The minority race the child decides to belong to\" – The passage does not say stereotypes influence which race a child chooses to belong to.\n   - Option 2: \"The child's behavior\" – The passage explicitly says stereotypes influence behavior.\n   - Option 3: \"Relationships with other children\" – The passage does not mention this.\n   - Option 4: \"The definition of race\" – The passage does not mention this.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "First, let's analyze the passage. It says that this is the largest acquisition in eBay's history. The company wants to diversify its sources of revenue and gain popularity in regions where Skype is strong, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"What is eBay trying to achieve with this acquisition?\"\n\nOption 1: \"Consolidate revenue\" — This means to focus or centralize revenue, but the passage says \"diversify revenue sources,\" which is the opposite.\n\nOption 2: \"Expand into new areas\" — The passage mentions eBay wants to become popular in new regions (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil) and diversify revenue, which matches this option.\n\nOption 3: \"Increase attention\" — While gaining attention might be a side effect, the passage does not mention this as a goal.\n\nOption 4: \"Satisfy shareholders\" — The passage does not mention shareholders or their satisfaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2.\n\n2"

      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice events.\n2. It also says that other snow sliding events will be held in Taizicheng, Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km from Beijing.\n3. The question asks which of the following will NOT take place in Beijing in 2022.\n4. Option 1: Opening ceremony – the passage says this will be in Beijing.\n5. Option 2: Snow sliding events in Taizicheng – the passage says these will be in Taizicheng, not Beijing.\n6. Option 3: Closing ceremony – the passage says this will be in Beijing.\n7. Option 4: Indoor ice events – the passage says these will be in Beijing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the event that will NOT take place in Beijing: snow sliding events in Taizicheng.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses \"timu za kawaida\" (regular teams) and \"timu pepe\" (virtual teams).\n2. It says that both types of teams are \"zinashikiliwa kwa viwango sawa vya ubora\" — they are held to the same standards of quality.\n3. However, it notes differences: virtual team members often act as communication points, have more freedom, and their teams may meet across different time zones, sometimes without management's full understanding.\n4. The passage also introduces the concept of an \"invisible team\" for management, but this is described as unique to virtual teams.\n5. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Both are expected to have the same level of performance — this matches the passage's statement about being held to the same standards.\n   - Option 2: Both have different levels of freedom — the passage says virtual teams have more freedom, so this is a difference, not a similarity.\n   - Option 3: Both work under invisible managers — the \"invisible team\" is unique to virtual teams, not both.\n   - Option 4: Both work in the same time zone — the passage says virtual teams can work across different time zones, so this is not a similarity.\n\nThe correct answer is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a medieval castle (\"Kasri la kiasili la zama za kati\") and the images or ideas it evokes.\n2. It mentions that the castle brings to mind \"mashindano ya kivita\" (tournaments or war competitions), \"karamu\" (banquets), and \"uungwana wa Kiartha\" (chivalry or nobility).\n3. It also describes the experience of standing among the ruins, imagining the \"sauti na harufu ya vita\" (sounds and smells of past wars), \"mlio wa kwato\" (sound of hooves), and \"uoga kutoka kwenye jela za chini kwa chini\" (fear from the underground dungeons).\n4. The passage then questions whether these ideas are based on truth and asks about the original purpose and construction of castles.\n\nNow, let's look at the options and see which one is NOT mentioned as something associated with medieval castles in the passage:\n\n1. Jela za chini kwa chini (underground dungeons) – Mentioned in the passage.\n2. Mashindano ya kivita (war tournaments) – Mentioned in the passage.\n3. Uungwana (chivalry/nobility) – Mentioned in the passage.\n4. Mashujaa (heroes/warriors) – This word is NOT mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses Indonesian food, specifically focusing on Javanese cuisine.\n2. It mentions that Javanese food is commonly found across the Indonesian archipelago.\n3. The passage lists the main flavors and ingredients in Javanese food: peanuts, chili, sugar (specifically Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.\n4. The question asks which type of sugar is commonly used in Javanese cuisine.\n5. The options are: white sugar, powdered sugar, palm sugar, and brown sugar.\n6. The passage specifically states \"sukari ya nazi ya Javanese,\" which translates to \"Javanese palm sugar.\"\n7. Among the options, \"sukari ya nazi\" (option 3) means \"palm sugar.\"\n\nFinal answer:\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a situation where passengers were given water while waiting in 90-degree heat. \n2. It mentions \"Mkuu wa Zimamoto Scott Kouns alisema...\" which translates to \"Fire Chief Scott Kouns said...\"\n3. The passage then quotes Scott Kouns commenting on the high temperature and the discomfort of being in the air carts for any length of time.\n4. The question asks: According to the passage, who commented that the high temperature was unsuitable?\n5. The options are: \n   1. Cart operator\n   2. Fire department supervisor\n   3. Passenger\n   4. Chief of police\n6. From the passage, it is clear that the comment about the high temperature being unsuitable was made by Scott Kouns, who is identified as \"Mkuu wa Zimamoto\" (Fire Chief/Fire department supervisor).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains that stars emit light and heat because of the energy produced when hydrogen atoms are fused together to form heavier elements.\n2. It also mentions that scientists are trying to create nuclear furnaces that can generate energy in the same way, but this is a difficult problem.\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, what does the fusion of atoms allow stars to do?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Kuunda elementi nzito zaidi\" means \"To create heavier elements.\" The passage does mention that fusion creates heavier elements, but the main focus is on what this process allows stars to do.\n   - Option 2: \"Kujenga matanuri ya kinyuklia\" means \"To build nuclear furnaces.\" The passage says scientists are trying to do this, not stars.\n   - Option 3: \"Kutoa mwanga na joto\" means \"To emit light and heat.\" The passage directly states that stars emit light and heat because of the energy from fusion.\n   - Option 4: \"Kutengeneza atomi za hidrojeni\" means \"To make hydrogen atoms.\" The passage says hydrogen atoms are fused, not created.\n\n5. The correct answer is option 3, as the passage directly links fusion to the emission of light and heat by stars.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the traditional path for the heir to the throne, which was to go directly into the military after finishing school.\n2. However, Charles did something different: he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History.\n3. He received a 2:2 degree (second class, lower division).\n4. The key sentence is: \"Charles alikuwa memba wa kwanza wa Familia ya Kifalme ya Kiingereza kuzawadiwa shahada ya digrii.\" This means \"Charles was the first member of the English Royal Family to be awarded a degree.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Join the military before finishing school – The passage says the tradition was to join the military after school, but Charles did not follow this; he went to university instead.\n2. Study Archaeology – The passage says he studied Archaeology, but it does not say he was the first to do so.\n3. Obtain a degree – The passage explicitly says he was the first member of the Royal Family to be awarded a degree.\n4. Study at Trinity College – The passage says he studied at Trinity College, but it does not say he was the first to do so.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses \"mafunzo ya usaidizi\" (supportive learning/training), which refers to platforms or aids that help people when they are encountering new learning situations, such as using new software or starting a new project. These aids can be virtual (like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office) or real (like a teacher).\n\n2. The passage specifically says that these aids are not the main way of learning, but rather a service that provides support during new or challenging learning experiences.\n\n3. Let's analyze each option:\n   - Option 1: \"Maelekezo mwanzoni mwa mchezo wa kompyuta\" (Instructions at the beginning of a computer game) – This is a supportive aid, as it helps users learn how to play the game.\n   - Option 2: \"Mwalimu wa SAT\" (SAT teacher) – This is a person who teaches and supports students preparing for the SAT, fitting the description of a supportive learning aid.\n   - Option 3: \"Mpango huru wa mafunzo\" (Independent learning program) – This is a program where the learner studies independently, without direct support or guidance. This does NOT fit the description of a supportive aid.\n   - Option 4: \"Kocha wa ligi ndogo\" (Little league coach) – This is a coach who supports and guides young players, fitting the description of a supportive learning aid.\n\n4. Therefore, the only option that is NOT an example of supportive learning (mafunzo ya usaidizi) is the independent learning program.\n\nFinal answer:\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses \"mitandao ya ukarimu\" (hospitality exchange networks), which connect travelers with hosts in the cities they visit.\n2. It explains that joining such a network usually involves filling out an online form, and sometimes further verification is required.\n3. The networks provide lists of available hosts, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers.\n4. The passage gives an example of Casey Fenton, who, after finding a cheap flight to Iceland but having no place to stay, emailed university students and received many offers of free accommodation.\n5. The main service described is the connection between travelers and hosts who offer them a place to stay.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. \"Malazi na wenyeji\" = Accommodation and hosts. This matches the passage, which is about travelers being offered places to stay by hosts.\n2. \"Ndege za bei nafuu\" = Cheap flights. The passage mentions a cheap flight as part of the example, but this is not what the networks provide.\n3. \"Ziara zinazotolewa na waelekezi wa ndani\" = Tours offered by local guides. The passage does not mention tours or guides.\n4. \"Miunganisho na wasafiri wengine wanaotembelea eneo hilo\" = Connections with other travelers visiting the area. The passage focuses on connecting travelers with hosts, not with other travelers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes two main types of tourism: \"utalii wa burudani\" (recreational tourism) and \"utalii wa kitamaduni\" (cultural tourism).\n2. Recreational tourism is when people travel to relax and enjoy themselves, often visiting beaches, parks, or campsites.\n3. Cultural tourism is when the purpose of visiting a place is to learn about its history and culture. This can involve visiting landmarks or focusing on a specific area.\n4. The question asks: \"Kutembelea makumbusho ni aina gani ya utalii?\" which means \"Visiting museums is what type of tourism?\"\n5. Museums are places where people learn about history and culture.\n6. According to the passage, if the goal is to learn about history and culture, it is called \"utalii wa kitamaduni\" (cultural tourism).\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses \"mshtuko wa kurudi tena\" (reverse culture shock), which happens when someone returns home after living abroad.\n2. It says this shock comes quickly, lasts longer, and can be more severe than the initial culture shock experienced when first going abroad.\n3. Importantly, it states: \"Wasafiri ambao walikuwa na wakati rahisi kuzoea utamaduni mpya wakati mwingine wana wakati mgumu wa kurekebisha upya utamaduni wao wa asili.\" This means: \"Travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a hard time readjusting to their original culture.\"\n4. The passage also mentions that when you first go abroad, people are patient and understanding, but when you return home, people may not realize you also need patience and understanding.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Travelers who experienced especially bad culture shock\n2. Travelers who adapted quickly when living abroad\n3. Travelers who are still in the honeymoon phase\n4. Travelers with little patience\n\nBased on the passage, the correct answer is the type of traveler who adapted quickly to the new culture, as they may have a harder time readjusting to their home culture.\n\nThe correct option is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the skill of throwing a boomerang, which is popular among tourists.\n2. It mentions that if you want to learn to throw a returning boomerang, you must have the correct type that will return.\n3. It also states that many boomerangs found in Australia are not of the returning type.\n4. Beginners are advised not to throw boomerangs during windy conditions.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. \"Itarudi kwa mkono yako kila wakati ikiwa inatupwa kwa usahihi\" (It will return to your hand every time if thrown correctly) – The passage does not say this. It says you need the correct type of boomerang, not that all will return if thrown correctly.\n2. \"Ni maarufu zaidi kati ya wenyeji kuliko watalii\" (It is more popular among locals than tourists) – The passage says the skill is popular among tourists, not locals.\n3. \"Hakuna bumarengi nyingi zinazopatikana nchini Australia\" (There are not many boomerangs available in Australia) – The passage says many boomerangs in Australia are not of the returning type, not that there are few boomerangs.\n4. \"Ni baadhi tu ya bumarengi zinaweza kurudi\" (Only some boomerangs can return) – This matches the passage, which says you need the correct type and that many do not return.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage talks about a rugby match between South Africa (Afrika Kusini, also called Springboks) and the All Blacks (New Zealand/Nyuzilandi).\n2. South Africa won the match by one point (21 to 20), ending the All Blacks' winning streak.\n3. For the Springboks, this ended a five-match losing streak.\n4. It was the last match for the All Blacks, who had already won the cup two weeks earlier.\n5. The passage then says: \"Mechi ya mwisho ya msururu itafanyika katika Ellis Park mjini Johannesburg wiki ijayo, wakati Springboks watakapocheza dhidi ya Australia.\"\n   - Translation: \"The last match of the series will take place at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks will play against Australia.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. All Blacks and Australia\n2. New Zealand and South Africa\n3. South Africa and Australia\n4. Springboks and All Blacks\n\nFrom the passage, the last match at Ellis Park will be between the Springboks (South Africa) and Australia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains two bowing directions for string instruments, using Swahili terms:\n   - \"Gubeti la juu\" (up bow) is marked with a V and means you start at the tip and push the bow.\n   - \"Gubeti la chini\" (down bow) is marked with a clamp-like or square symbol missing its bottom side, and means you start at the frog (the part you hold) and pull the bow.\n\n2. The passage further explains:\n   - Up bow (\"upinde wa juu\") usually produces a softer (tulivu) sound.\n   - Down bow (\"upinde wa chini\") is stronger and more stable (nguvu na imara zaidi).\n\n3. The passage also says you can write your own bowing marks, but printed ones should be respected.\n\nNow, the question asks: \"According to the passage, which of the following is NOT related to 'kuvuta gubeti' (pulling the bow)?\"\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n1. \"Sauti tulivu\" (soft/quiet sound): The passage says this is produced by the up bow, which is pushing, not pulling.\n2. \"Alama inayoonekana kama kibanio\" (symbol that looks like a clamp): The passage says this is the symbol for down bow, which is pulling.\n3. \"Sauti yenye nguvu zaidi\" (stronger sound): The passage says this is produced by the down bow, which is pulling.\n4. \"Kuanza kwenye frog\" (starting at the frog): The passage says this is how you do the down bow, which is pulling.\n\nSo, the only option NOT related to pulling the bow is option 1, because a soft sound is associated with pushing (up bow), not pulling (down bow).\n\nFinal answer:\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says: \"Martelly aliapisha Baraza mpya la muda la Uchaguzi la (CEP) la wanachama tisa jana. Ni CEP ya tano ya Martelly katika miaka minne.\"  \n   Translation: Martelly swore in a new temporary Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday. It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.\n\n2. \"Mwezi uliopita tume ya rais ilipendekeza kujiuzulu kwa CEP iliyotangulia kama sehemu ya kifurushi cha hatua za kusogeza nchi kuelekea uchaguzi mpya.\"  \n   Translation: Last month, the president's commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of steps to move the country toward new elections.\n\n3. The question is: \"Nani alipendekeza CEP iliyotangulia ijiuzulu?\"  \n   Translation: Who recommended that the previous CEP resign?\n\n4. The options are:\n   1. Martelly\n   2. Protesters\n   3. The president's commission\n   4. The CEP members themselves\n\n5. From the passage, it is clear that \"tume ya rais\" (the president's commission) recommended the resignation of the previous CEP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses an outbreak of a disease that is carried by pigs and transmitted to humans by mosquitoes.\n2. The Indian government has taken several actions:\n   - Sending pig hunters to affected areas.\n   - Distributing thousands of mosquito nets.\n   - Spraying insecticides.\n   - Promising millions of vials of encephalitis vaccine to prepare health workers for the next year.\n3. It is mentioned that the plan to deliver the vaccine to historically affected areas this year was delayed due to lack of funds and lower priority compared to other diseases.\n\nNow, the question asks: According to the passage, which preventive measure against the disease will be implemented last?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n1. Insecticides (spraying)\n2. Pig hunters\n3. Encephalitis vaccine\n4. Mosquito nets\n\nFrom the passage, the first three measures (pig hunters, mosquito nets, insecticides) are already being implemented. However, the vaccine is only promised for the next year, and its delivery this year was delayed. Therefore, the vaccine will be implemented last.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that \"Mazoea ya lishe sahihi pekee haiwezi kuzalisha usomi wa utendaji, ila yanaweza kuathiri kwa kiasi kikubwa na ustawi wa wakimbiaji wachanga kwa ujumla.\" This means that proper nutrition alone cannot produce performance excellence, but it can greatly affect the well-being of young runners.\n\n2. The passage continues: \"Kudumisha uwiano bora wa kawi, kuwa na mazoea ya unywaji wa maji yenye ufanisi, na kuelewa vipengele tofauti vya mazoea ya ziada kunaweza kusaidia wanariadha kuboresha utendaji wao na kuongeza raha yao katika spoti hiyo.\" This means: maintaining a good energy balance, having effective hydration habits, and understanding different aspects of additional practices can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment in the sport.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Mazoea ya lishe sahihi\" (Proper nutrition habits) – The passage mentions this as important for well-being.\n2. \"Kuwa katika kiwango cha usomi wa utendaji mara kwa mara\" (Being at a high level of performance excellence regularly) – The passage specifically says that proper nutrition alone cannot produce performance excellence, and it does not recommend this as a way to increase enjoyment.\n3. \"Unywaji maji kwa ufanisi\" (Effective hydration) – The passage recommends this.\n4. \"Kudumisha uwiano bora wa kawi\" (Maintaining a good energy balance) – The passage recommends this.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is NOT recommended as a way for young athletes to get more enjoyment from their sport is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the transition from quarter-mile to half-mile races.\n2. It states that in half-mile races, speed becomes less important, and endurance (uvumilivu) becomes the most important requirement.\n3. It mentions that a first-class half-mile runner (mkimbiaji wa daraja la kwanza) must have enough speed, but endurance must be developed at all times.\n4. It also says that moderate cross-country running in winter and gym activities for the upper body are the best preparation.\n5. The question asks: According to the passage, what is most important for a first-class half-mile runner?\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. Doing moderate cross-country running in winter – this is mentioned as good preparation, but not as the most important thing.\n2. Developing endurance more than speed – the passage explicitly says endurance is the most important requirement, and must be developed at all times, while speed is less important.\n3. Qualifying in two minutes – this is a standard for a first-class runner, but not the most important thing according to the passage.\n4. Developing speed more than endurance – the passage says the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the difficulty that large mammals (like humans) have in meeting their amino acid (protein) needs from plant sources in the savanna. It mentions that plant resources like leaves and legumes are hard to digest unless cooked.\n2. The passage contrasts this with animal foods (like ants, termites, eggs), which are not only easier to digest but also provide high-quality protein with essential amino acids.\n3. The passage concludes that our ancestors likely solved their \"protein problem\" in the same way as savanna monkeys do today—by eating animal foods.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. \"Majani yaliyokauka\" = dried leaves. The passage says leaves are hard to digest and not a good solution.\n2. \"Kunde ambazo hazijapikwa\" = uncooked legumes. The passage says legumes are hard to digest unless cooked, so not a good solution.\n3. \"Panzi\" = grasshoppers. These are animal foods, similar to ants and termites mentioned in the passage as good sources of protein.\n4. \"Mashina ya maua\" = flower stems. These are plant parts, and the passage suggests plant parts are not easily digested for protein.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the animal food: grasshoppers.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how making a long-distance phone call (to someone thousands of miles away) involves the use of a satellite.\n2. It explains that a satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down to Earth almost instantly.\n3. The passage also mentions that satellites are sent into space using rockets, and that scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts light and our view.\n4. The question asks: Which of the following is correct about long-distance calls returning to Earth?\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - 1. Darubini (Telescope): The passage says telescopes are used for scientific observation, not for phone calls.\n   - 2. Satelaiti (Satellite): The passage clearly states that satellites are used to receive and reflect long-distance calls back to Earth.\n   - 3. Taa (Light): The passage does not mention light as being involved in returning calls to Earth.\n   - 4. Roketi (Rocket): Rockets are used to send satellites or telescopes into space, not for handling phone calls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 2, as satellites are responsible for handling long-distance calls as described in the passage.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the gravitational pull (\"mvuto\") on Io (a moon of Jupiter) compared to Earth.\n2. It states that if you stood on Io, you would weigh less than you do on Earth. For example, a person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io.\n3. This means that the gravitational pull on Io is much weaker than on Earth.\n4. The question asks which statement is correct about gravity on Io.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. \"Mvuto wa Dunia utakuvuta kidogo kuliko mvuto wa Io\" — This says Earth's gravity pulls you less than Io's. This is incorrect; the passage says Earth's gravity is stronger.\n2. \"Mvuto wa Io huvuta zaidi, ndiyo sababu uzito wako ungepungua\" — This says Io's gravity pulls more, so your weight would decrease. This is incorrect; if gravity pulled more, your weight would increase.\n3. \"Mvuto wa Io huvuta zaidi, ndiyo sababu uzito wako ungeongezeka\" — This says Io's gravity pulls more, so your weight would increase. This is also incorrect; the passage says your weight would decrease.\n4. \"Mvuto wa dunia utakuvuta zaidi kuliko mvuto wa Io\" — This says Earth's gravity pulls you more than Io's. This matches the passage, which says you would weigh less on Io because its gravity is weaker.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes an incident involving a photographer who was taken to a medical center and later died. \n2. It mentions that the photographer stopped his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and tried to take pictures of a police roadblock (\"alijaribu kupiga picha za kizuizi cha polisi\").\n3. The photographer then crossed the road, and a police officer told him to go back twice.\n4. The question asks what the photographer was trying to do before being hit by a car.\n5. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: Parking the car is mentioned, but the main action before being hit was not parking.\n   - Option 2: Taking pictures of the police roadblock is explicitly stated in the passage.\n   - Option 3: Crossing the busy road is mentioned, but the main intent was to take pictures.\n   - Option 4: Persuading the officer is not mentioned as his main action.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is the action of taking pictures of the police roadblock.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, has issued a warning about \"extremists from Somalia\" planning a bomb attack in Kenya and Ethiopia.\n2. The information received specifically mentions the use of suicide bombers to target \"famous landmarks\" in both Ethiopia and Kenya.\n3. The question asks which statement correctly describes the alleged attack plan of the extremists.\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Kulipua mabomu kwenye alamardhi za nchi moja\" = Bombing landmarks in one country. This is incorrect because the passage mentions two countries.\n   - Option 2: \"Kulipua mabomu katika nchi mbili\" = Bombing in two countries. This is partially correct, but it doesn't specify landmarks.\n   - Option 3: \"Kulipua mabomu kwenye alamardhi za nchi mbili\" = Bombing landmarks in two countries. This matches the passage, which mentions targeting famous landmarks in both Kenya and Ethiopia.\n   - Option 4: \"Kulipua mabomu katika nchi moja\" = Bombing in one country. This is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes Kirby Muxloe Castle as more of a fortified house than a true castle. It mentions that the windows are large and made of glass, and the walls are thin, which means they could not withstand a prolonged attack.\n2. The passage states that in the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began its construction, the country was relatively peaceful, and only minimal protection was needed, mainly against small groups of bandits.\n3. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Kuta pana za ngome hiyo ziliombwa na Lord Hastings\" (The wide walls of the castle were requested by Lord Hastings) – The passage actually says the walls were thin, not wide, so this is incorrect.\n   - Option 2: \"Lilihitaji ulinzi mdogo kwa sababu ya hali ya amani ya nchi wakati wa ujenzi wake\" (It needed little protection because of the peaceful state of the country at the time of its construction) – This matches the passage, which says only minimal protection was needed due to the peaceful situation.\n   - Option 3: \"Ujenzi wa ngome haukuwa wa kawaida katika kipindi hicho\" (Building castles was not common in that period) – The passage does not mention whether building castles was common or not, so this is not supported.\n   - Option 4: \"Lilijengwa ili kupinga mashambulio makali ya muda mrefu\" (It was built to withstand prolonged, intense attacks) – The passage says the opposite: the castle could not withstand prolonged attacks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses a new policy by the Komen organization, which states that grants or funding cannot be given to organizations under legal investigation.\n2. Because of this policy, Komen stopped funding Planned Parenthood.\n3. The reason for this is that Planned Parenthood is under investigation regarding how it uses and reports its funds.\n4. The investigation is being led by Representative Cliff Stearns, who is the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, which is under the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n5. The question asks: \"Which organization is under legal investigation?\"\n6. Option 1 (Kamati ya nyumba, nishati na biashara) refers to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which is conducting the investigation, not being investigated.\n7. Option 2 (Shirika la Komen) is the organization making the policy, not being investigated.\n8. Option 3 (Uzazi Uliopangwa) is the Swahili term for Planned Parenthood, which the passage clearly states is under investigation.\n9. Option 4 (Usimamizi na Upelelezi kwenye kamati ndogo) is the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, which is conducting the investigation, not being investigated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the eating habits of Triceratops, specifically their ability to crush not only leaves but also tough branches and roots.\n2. It mentions that some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, a type of plant common in the Cretaceous period.\n3. Cycads are described as small palm-like plants with crowns of sharp, spiny leaves.\n4. The passage states: \"Triseratops angeutumia mdomo wake wenye nguvu kuyatoa majani kabla ya kula shina.\" This translates to: \"Triceratops would use its strong mouth to remove the leaves before eating the stem.\"\n5. This means that, according to the passage, Triceratops could eat the stem of the cycad after removing the leaves.\n6. The question asks: \"According to the passage, which part of the cycad plant could Triceratops eat?\"\n7. The options are: 1. Spiny leaves, 2. Stem, 3. Root, 4. Fruit.\n8. Based on the passage, the correct answer is the stem.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage and each option step by step:\n\n**Passage summary:**  \n- Goma is a tourist city in eastern DRC, near Rwanda.\n- In 2002, it was damaged by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano.\n- Goma is generally safe, but trips outside should be checked due to ongoing conflict in North Kivu.\n- The city is a base for climbing Nyiragongo and for tracking mountain gorillas.\n- Motorbike taxis (boda-boda) are a common and cheap way to get around.\n\n**Now, let's look at each option:**\n\n1. \"Mapigano kwenye Kaskazini mwa Kivu ni ya kuburudisha\"  \n   Translation: \"The fighting in North Kivu is entertaining.\"  \n   - The passage warns that there is ongoing conflict in North Kivu and that visitors should check the situation before traveling outside Goma. It does NOT suggest that the fighting is entertaining or a tourist attraction. In fact, it implies the opposite: that it is dangerous.\n\n2. \"Ni mahali pazuri kwa Ufuatiliaji wa Masokwe wa Milima kwa bei nafuu\"  \n   Translation: \"It is a good place for tracking mountain gorillas at an affordable price.\"  \n   - The passage says Goma is a base for tracking mountain gorillas and mentions \"rahisi kabisa\" (very easy/affordable), so this is a good tip.\n\n3. \"Teksi za pikipiki ni njia nzuri ya kuzunguka\"  \n   Translation: \"Motorbike taxis are a good way to get around.\"  \n   - The passage says you can use boda-boda to get around Goma and gives the local fare, so this is a good tip.\n\n4. \"Msingi wa volkano ya Nyiragongo uko mjini\"  \n   Translation: \"The base of the Nyiragongo volcano is in the city.\"  \n   - The passage says Goma is the base for climbing Nyiragongo, so this is a reasonable tip.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOption 1 is NOT a good tip for a tourist in Goma, as it misrepresents the danger of the conflict as entertainment.\n\n**Answer:**  \n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses two main ways to travel easily: working while traveling or reducing your expenses. The article focuses on the second way—reducing expenses to almost zero.\n2. It mentions that to do this, travelers must be willing to give up comfort, time, and predictability.\n3. The advice assumes that travelers do not steal, interfere, participate in illegal markets, beg, or exploit others.\n4. The question asks: Who might have a hard time traveling on a very low budget?\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Someone who welcomes challenges. The passage suggests that traveling on a low budget is challenging, so someone who likes challenges would not have a hard time.\n   - Option 2: Someone with plenty of time. The passage says you need to give up time, so having more time would make it easier, not harder.\n   - Option 3: Someone planning to work while traveling. The passage says there are two groups: those who work while traveling and those who reduce expenses. The article focuses on the second group, so this person is not the focus.\n   - Option 4: Someone who likes to follow a schedule. The passage says you must give up predictability (ratiba), so someone who likes to follow a schedule would have a hard time.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland compared to that spoken in France.\n2. It says that these varieties are slightly different but mutually intelligible.\n3. Specifically, it mentions that the number system in Belgian and Swiss French has some unusual features that are different from the French spoken in France.\n4. It also says that the pronunciation of some words is a little different.\n5. However, all Belgians and Swiss who speak French learned standard French in school, so they can understand you even if you use the French number system.\n6. The question asks: Which of the following is NOT the same in France as it is in Belgium or Switzerland?\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. \"Matamshi ya maneno yote\" = Pronunciation of all words. The passage says pronunciation of some words is a little different, not all words.\n2. \"Mfumo wa nambari\" = Number system. The passage specifically says the number system is different in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France.\n3. \"Kifaransa cha kawaida kinachofundishwa shuleni\" = Standard French taught in schools. The passage says all learned standard French in school, so this is the same.\n4. \"Uandishi wa baadhi ya maneno ya Kifaransa\" = The writing of some French words. The passage does not mention any difference in writing.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that is NOT the same in France as in Belgium or Switzerland. The passage clearly states that the number system is different.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The question asks: \"According to the passage, when did the phase change occur?\"\n2. Let's look for information about the \"phase change\" in the passage.\n3. The passage says: \"Shughuli kuu ya mtetemeko wa ardhi iliyokuwa na matokeo ya mbadiliko wa awamu ilikuwa imetokea mnamo 10 Machi upande wa kaskazini mashariki mwa bonde kuu la kilele cha volikano.\"\n   - Translation: \"The main earthquake activity that resulted in a phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the main caldera of the volcano.\"\n4. This sentence directly states that the phase change occurred on March 10.\n5. Now, let's check the options:\n   - 1. Before March 10\n   - 2. Within the past 48 hours\n   - 3. On March 10\n   - 4. In the past week\n6. The correct answer, based on the passage, is \"On March 10.\"\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the concept of time and how it is perceived and measured.\n2. It mentions that time can be marked by observing the repetition of a cyclical event.\n3. The key phrase is: \"Unaweza kuweka alama ya upitaji wa saa wewe mwenyewe kwa kuangalia marudio ya tukio la kimzunguko.\" This translates to: \"You can mark the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event.\"\n4. The question asks: What should be considered about a cyclical event to track the passage of time?\n5. The options are:\n   1. Muda (Duration/Time)\n   2. Marudio (Repetition/Frequency)\n   3. Athari (Effect)\n   4. Ugumu (Difficulty)\n6. The passage specifically highlights \"marudio\" (repetition) as the way to mark the passage of time using cyclical events.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses a document (hati hiyo) and what issues it addresses.\n2. It mentions that the document will refer to the border dispute, specifically that Palestine wants borders based on those before the 1967 Middle East War.\n3. It also says other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem (Yerusalemu) and the issue of the Jordan Valley (Bonde la Yordani).\n4. Regarding the Jordan Valley, it says Israel wants to maintain a military presence for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA wants it removed after five years.\n5. Now, let's look at the options:\n   - Option 1: The future status of Jerusalem — This is mentioned as being addressed.\n   - Option 2: The cause of the 1967 war — The passage does not mention the cause of the war, only that borders should be based on those before the war.\n   - Option 3: Military presence in the valley — This is discussed in detail.\n   - Option 4: Border dispute — This is mentioned as being addressed.\n\n6. Therefore, the only issue among the options that is NOT included in the document, according to the passage, is the cause of the 1967 war.\n\nAnswer:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says Martelly swore in a new temporary Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members. This is his fifth CEP in four years.\n2. Last month, the president's commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of steps to move the country toward new elections.\n3. The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the government that began in October.\n4. These protests, which were sometimes violent, were sparked by the lack of elections, some of which have been delayed since 2011.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. \"Tume ya rais ilikuwa jibu kwa maandamano\" — The passage says the commission was Martelly's response to the protests. This is TRUE.\n2. \"Kuchelewa kwa uchaguzi kulisababisha maandamano hayo\" — The passage says the protests were sparked by the lack of elections and delays since 2011. This is TRUE.\n3. \"Maandamano yalidai kujiuzulu kwa CEP iliyotangulia\" — The passage says the president's commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP, but it does NOT say the protests specifically demanded the resignation of the previous CEP. The protests were against the government and about the lack of elections, not specifically about the CEP's resignation. This is NOT TRUE.\n4. \"Wakati mwingine maandamano hayo yalikuwa ya vurugu\" — The passage says the protests were sometimes violent. This is TRUE.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true about the protests is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage is about Johnny Reid, a co-driver for the New Zealand A1GP team, who made history by legally driving a race car over the Auckland Harbour Bridge at high speed.\n2. He drove the car, called \"Urembo Mweusi,\" at speeds over 160 km/h seven times across the bridge.\n3. The New Zealand police had trouble using their speed radar guns to measure his speed because the car was too low for the radar to detect while he was driving fast.\n4. However, the police were able to measure his speed when he slowed down to 160 km/h.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Polisi waliweza kutumia lini bunduki za rada kupima kasi ya Jonny Reid ya kuendesha gari?\"  \nTranslation: \"When were the police able to use radar guns to measure Jonny Reid's driving speed?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Akiwa anaendesha kwa kasi ya 160km/h — When he was driving at 160 km/h\n2. Mara yake ya saba kupita juu ya daraja — On his seventh time crossing the bridge\n3. Alipokuwa akiendesha zaidi ya 160km/h — When he was driving over 160 km/h\n4. Mara yake ya kwanza juu ya daraja — On his first time over the bridge\n\nFrom the passage, the police could not measure his speed when he was going over 160 km/h, but they could when he slowed down to 160 km/h. Therefore, the correct answer is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes \"bizari\" as a food made from plants and spices, with either meat or vegetables. It can be \"dry\" or \"wet\" depending on the amount of liquid.\n2. It then says that in North India and Pakistan, \"mtindi\" (yogurt) is commonly used in the spicy sauce.\n3. In South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, \"maziwa ya nazi\" (coconut milk) is often used.\n\nThe question asks: In some regions, coconut milk is sometimes used instead of which ingredient in \"bizari\"?\n\nLooking at the passage, it contrasts the use of yogurt in the north with coconut milk in the south. This means that in the south, coconut milk is used instead of yogurt.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. Nyama (meat)\n2. Mboga (vegetables)\n3. Mtindi (yogurt)\n4. Viungo (spices)\n\nThe correct answer is \"mtindi\" (yogurt).\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a region bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west. It gives advice specifically for female travelers.\n2. The advice includes: women should say they are married regardless of their actual marital status, wear a ring (but not an expensive-looking one), and be aware that cultural differences may lead to what they perceive as harassment (such as being followed or grabbed).\n3. The passage emphasizes that women should be firm in refusing unwanted advances and should not be afraid to stand their ground, regardless of cultural differences.\n4. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Tambua kuwa sni jambo la kawaida kufuatwa\" (\"Recognize that it is normal to be followed\") — The passage says it is not uncommon, but does not suggest accepting it as normal or okay.\n   - Option 2: \"Vaa pete kubwa kuashiria hali ya ndoa\" (\"Wear a big ring to indicate marital status\") — The passage says to wear a ring, but specifically says not to wear one that looks too expensive or big.\n   - Option 3: \"Elewa kwamba tofauti za kitamaduni zinapendekeza kwamba uepuke kushikilia msimamo wako\" (\"Understand that cultural differences suggest you should avoid standing your ground\") — The passage says the opposite: stand your ground even if there are cultural differences.\n   - Option 4: \"Panapokuwa na uviziaji usiotakikana, kuwa imara katika kuwakatalia wanaume\" (\"When there is unwanted attention, be firm in refusing men\") — This matches the passage's advice to be firm and not afraid to refuse unwanted advances.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the distribution of the \"Dunlap Broadsides,\" which are printed copies of a certain important document.\n2. The process started after approval by Congress on July 4, when a handwritten draft was signed and sent to John Dunlap's print shop.\n3. That night, 150-200 copies were printed.\n4. The first public reading was by John Nixon at Independence Hall (Ukumbi wa Uhuru) on July 8.\n5. One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he had it read to his troops in New York on July 9.\n6. A copy arrived in London on August 10.\n7. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.\n\nNow, let's look at the options and see which location received the Dunlap Broadsides last:\n\n1. New York: Received the document on July 9.\n2. Dunlap's print shop: This is where the documents were first printed, so it was the first place to have them.\n3. London: Received the document on August 10.\n4. Independence Hall (Ukumbi wa Uhuru): The first public reading was on July 8.\n\nComparing the dates:\n- Dunlap's print shop: July 4-5 (printing night)\n- Independence Hall: July 8\n- New York: July 9\n- London: August 10\n\nTherefore, London was the last to receive the Dunlap Broadsides.\n\nFinal answer:\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the main foods of Majokan cuisine, which is similar to other Mediterranean coastal regions.\n2. It specifically mentions that the foods are made with bread (mkate), vegetables (mboga), and meat (nyama, especially pork), and always use olive oil.\n3. It gives an example of a simple evening meal: \"Pa ambi Oli,\" which consists of bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and other available ingredients like cheese and tuna.\n4. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Nyama (meat) – The passage says meat, especially pork, is a main component.\n   - Option 2: Mkate (bread) – Bread is mentioned as a main ingredient.\n   - Option 3: Nafaka (cereals/grains) – The passage does not mention cereals or grains as a staple.\n   - Option 4: Mboga (vegetables) – Vegetables are mentioned as a main ingredient.\n5. Therefore, the only option that is NOT mentioned as a staple food in the passage is \"nafaka\" (cereals/grains).\n\nFinal answer:\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage explains that avalanches (maporomoko ya theluji) are not ordinary events; a steep slope can hold a certain amount of snow, but extra snow will fall as an avalanche.\n2. It says that snow is \"danganyifu\" (deceptive), so it needs to be triggered to fall, and a small fall can trigger the rest.\n3. The passage lists possible triggers (kichochezi) for avalanches: sometimes the natural event is the sun heating the snow (jua kupasha joto theluji), sometimes more snowfall (kuanguka zaidi kwa theluji), sometimes natural events, and often humans (binadamu).\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Theluji danganyifu (deceptive snow)\n2. Binadamu (humans)\n3. Mwanga wa jua (sunlight)\n4. Kuanguka zaidi kwa theluji (more snowfall)\n\nFrom the passage:\n- Humans, sunlight (sun heating the snow), and more snowfall are all mentioned as triggers.\n- \"Theluji danganyifu\" (deceptive snow) is not listed as a trigger; rather, it is described as a property of the snow, not a cause.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses famous Greeks, including Homer, Sophocles, Aristophanes, and Pythagoras.\n2. It specifically mentions Homer as a poet (\"malenga wa mashairi\") who was blind (\"aliyekuwa kipofu\").\n3. The question asks: \"What was the Greek poet Homer unable to do?\"\n4. The options are:\n   1. Kusikia (to hear)\n   2. Kuona (to see)\n   3. Kutembea (to walk)\n   4. Kuongea (to speak)\n5. Since the passage says Homer was blind, he was unable to see.\n\nAnswer:\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses airlines expanding their services in Africa and suggests comparing the total fare to Africa with a round-the-world fare.\n2. It specifically advises not to forget to add extra costs such as \"visa za ziada\" (extra visas), \"ushuru wa kuondoka\" (departure taxes), \"usafiri kwenye ardhi\" (ground transport), etc., for all those segments outside Africa.\n3. The question asks: What does NOT need to be added when comparing the total Africa fare with the international fare?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Gharama ya visa za ziada kwa maeneo ya nje ya Afrika\" (Cost of extra visas for places outside Africa) — The passage says to add this.\n   - Option 2: \"Gharama ya ushuru wa kuondoka barani Afrika\" (Cost of departure tax within Africa) — The passage says to add departure taxes for places outside Africa, not within Africa.\n   - Option 3: \"Gharama ya visa ya Kiafrika\" (Cost of African visa) — The passage says to add extra visa costs for places outside Africa, not specifically for Africa.\n   - Option 4: \"Gharama ya usafiri kwenye ardhi kwa maeneo nje ya Afrika\" (Cost of ground transport for places outside Africa) — The passage says to add this.\n\n5. Therefore, the only cost that does NOT need to be added, according to the passage, is the departure tax within Africa.\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage quotes Hu saying: \"We will try to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP to a significant level by 2020 from the 2005 level.\" This means a reduction is planned, and the time frame (by 2020) is mentioned.\n2. Hu did not specify the exact amount or percentage of reduction, only that it will be \"significant\" and based on China's economic output.\n3. Hu urged developing countries to \"avoid the traditional path of polluting first and cleaning up later.\" This is advice to developing countries about pollution.\n4. He added that developing countries \"should not, however, be asked to take on responsibilities beyond their stage of development, responsibility, and capability.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Msingi wa upunguzaji\" (The basis for reduction): The passage mentions that the reduction will be based on economic output (GDP), so this is mentioned.\n2. \"Ushauri kwa nchi zinazoendelea kuhusu uchafuzi wa mazingira\" (Advice to developing countries about pollution): This is mentioned, as Hu gives advice to developing countries.\n3. \"Wakati ambapo utoaji wa kaboni utapunguzwa\" (The time when carbon emissions will be reduced): The passage says \"by 2020,\" so the time is mentioned.\n4. \"Nambari ya kupunguzwa kwa utoaji wa kaboni\" (The number/amount of carbon emission reduction): The passage specifically says that Hu did not set a reduction amount, only that it will be significant and based on economic output.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the religious practices of the Babylonians, specifically how they built temples for their gods. Each god had a temple considered their house.\n2. People (the general public) would bring offerings (dhabihu) to the gods, and priests would handle the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.\n3. Each temple had an open courtyard (uwanja wazi wa kasri) and an inner sanctuary (mahali pa ndani patakatifu) where only priests (makasisi) were allowed to enter.\n4. Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temple, with the top being the holy dwelling of the god.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"Akileta dhabihu kwenye uwanja wa hekalu\" – Bringing offerings in the temple courtyard. The passage says people could bring offerings, so ordinary citizens could be here.\n2. \"Akihudhuria sherehe katika hekalu kuu\" – Attending a ceremony in the main temple. The passage mentions people attending ceremonies, so this is possible for ordinary citizens.\n3. \"Kwenye tamasha katika uwanja wa hekalu\" – At a festival in the temple courtyard. Again, the passage says people could attend festivals, so this is possible.\n4. \"Akileta dhabihu kwenye mahali pa ndani patakatifu\" – Bringing offerings in the inner sanctuary. The passage specifically says only priests could enter the inner sanctuary, so ordinary citizens could not be here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses what happens after many hours of operation: the filament (\"uzi wa balbu\") burns out (\"unaungua\") and the light bulb (\"balbu ya nuru\") can no longer work.\n2. It then says the light bulb needs to be replaced and gives safety instructions for replacing it, such as turning off the switch or disconnecting the wire to avoid electric shock.\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, what causes the light bulb to stop working?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Swichi ya taa nyepesi kutozimwa kwa njia sahihi\" (The light switch not being turned off properly) – The passage mentions turning off the switch for safety, not as a cause for the bulb to stop working.\n   - Option 2: \"Sehemu ya chini ya metali ya balbu kubaki nje ya tundu\" (The metal base of the bulb remaining outside the socket) – The passage mentions the metal part in the context of safety, not as a cause for failure.\n   - Option 3: \"Uzi ndani ya balbu kuungua\" (The filament inside the bulb burning out) – The passage explicitly states that after many hours, the filament burns out and the bulb stops working.\n   - Option 4: \"Kupungua kwa mtiririko wa umeme kwenye tundu\" (A decrease in the flow of electricity in the socket) – The passage does not mention this as a cause.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the dress code for visiting monasteries. Women are expected to wear skirts that cover the knees and cover their shoulders. Many monasteries provide kangas (a type of cloth) for women who come without them.\n2. It is mentioned that if you bring your own kanga, especially a brightly colored one, you will be smiled at by the monks or sisters at the entrance.\n3. For men, they are required to wear trousers that cover the knees. These can also be borrowed from a supply at the gate.\n4. However, it is noted that these borrowed clothes (skirts for men) are not washed after every use, which may make some people uncomfortable.\n5. The question asks: Which of the following clothes cannot be borrowed from the monastery?\n6. Let's analyze the options:\n   - 1. Skirt: The passage says skirts can be borrowed.\n   - 2. Shorts (suruali fupi): The passage does not mention shorts being available, and in fact, the dress code requires covering the knees, so shorts would not be appropriate or provided.\n   - 3. Long trousers (suruali ndefu): The passage says trousers that cover the knees can be borrowed.\n   - 4. Kanga: The passage says kangas are provided for women who come without them.\n7. Therefore, the only item that cannot be borrowed is \"suruali fupi\" (shorts), as they do not meet the dress code and are not mentioned as being available.\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes a rugby sevens tournament that started at 10 am with good weather, except for some brief rain.\n2. South Africa, the top team, started well by easily defeating Zambia 26-00.\n3. The passage mentions that South Africa seemed to weaken in a game against their southern sisters (possibly another southern African team), but as the tournament continued, they stood out.\n4. The key sentence is: \"Afrika Kusini hata hivyo walitia fora jinsi mashindano yalivyoendelea.\" This means \"South Africa, however, excelled as the tournament went on.\"\n5. Their disciplined defense, skill, and teamwork made them stand out, and it became clear they were the team to beat.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"Karibu saa nne asubuhi\" – Around 10 am. The passage does not say their performance improved specifically at this time.\n2. \"Baada ya kuimarisha ulinzi\" – After strengthening their defense. The passage mentions their good defense, but not that their improvement started after this.\n3. \"Baada ya kushindwa na Zambia\" – After losing to Zambia. This is incorrect; they defeated Zambia.\n4. \"Mashindano yalipokuwa yanaendelea\" – As the tournament was going on. This matches the passage, which says they excelled as the tournament continued.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses two types of genetic diversity: hidden (fiche) and expressed (zilizoelezewa).\n2. It mentions that \"Mabadiliko huongeza tofauti za kimaumbile,\" which translates to \"Mutations increase morphological (physical) differences.\"\n3. The passage also says that selection removes some of the expressed differences, and recombination and segregation shuffle differences between the two pools each generation.\n4. The question asks: Which process is responsible for increasing genetic diversity?\n5. From the passage, \"mabadiliko\" (mutations) are directly stated to increase diversity.\n6. The other options (segregation, recombination, expressed) are not described as increasing diversity, but rather as shuffling or removing it.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says Bobek was born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.\n2. He became famous while playing for Partizan Belgrade.\n3. He joined Partizan in 1945 and stayed until 1958.\n4. During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 matches.\n5. No one else has played more matches or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.\n6. In 1995, he was chosen as the best player in Partizan's history.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n1. \"Alianza kuichezea Partizan mnamo 1945\" — He started playing for Partizan in 1945. This matches the passage.\n2. \"Aliichezea Zagreb kabla ya Partizan Belgrade\" — He played for Zagreb before Partizan Belgrade. The passage only says he was born in Zagreb, not that he played for a team there.\n3. \"Aliichezea Partizan hadi 1995\" — He played for Partizan until 1995. The passage says he played until 1958, not 1995.\n4. \"Alipata umaarufu baada ya kuchaguliwa kuwa mchezaji bora wa Partizan\" — He became famous after being chosen as the best player of Partizan. The passage says he became famous while playing for Partizan, not after 1995.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how children develop a sense of nationalism and tribal stereotypes from a young age, and that these stereotypes affect their behavior.\n2. It gives an example: children associated with a minority tribe that is believed to perform poorly in school actually start performing poorly once they become aware of the stereotype about their tribe.\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, a child's knowledge of tribal stereotypes can affect which of the following?\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. \"Jamii ya wachache wanayochagua kujitambulisha nayo\" – The minority community they choose to identify with. The passage does not mention children choosing which minority group to identify with.\n2. \"Tabia yao\" – Their behavior. The passage explicitly says that stereotypes affect behavior.\n3. \"Uhusiano wao na watoto wengine\" – Their relationship with other children. The passage does not mention relationships with other children.\n4. \"Ufafanuzi wao wa kabila\" – Their definition of tribe. The passage does not discuss how children define tribe.\n\nThe only option directly supported by the passage is option 2: \"Tabia yao\" (their behavior).\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses a major purchase made by eBay, described as the largest in its history.\n2. The passage states that the company hopes to \"expand its sources of profit\" and \"gain popularity in areas where Skype has a strong position, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\"\n3. The question asks what eBay is trying to achieve through this purchase.\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Kukusanya mapato yake\" (To increase its revenue) – The passage mentions expanding sources of profit, which is related to increasing revenue.\n   - Option 2: \"Kuingia katika masoko mapya\" (To enter new markets) – The passage specifically mentions gaining popularity in new regions (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil), which are new markets for eBay.\n   - Option 3: \"Kuboresha wasifu wake\" (To improve its profile) – The passage does not mention improving its profile or image.\n   - Option 4: \"Kuridhisha wanahisa wake\" (To satisfy its shareholders) – The passage does not mention shareholders.\n\n5. The most direct goal mentioned in the passage is to expand into new regions/markets where Skype is strong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2"

      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage says that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars.\n2. It specifically mentions that the activity of all stars in the cluster is driven by their \"प्रकाश\" (brightness/luminosity) and \"परिक्रमण\" (rotation), and not by any other reason.\n3. It further explains that to find a star's Rossby number (related to plasma flow), both its brightness and rotation are used together.\n4. The Rossby number itself is a derived quantity, not a direct driver, but is used to measure activity.\n5. The passage does not say that Rossby number or magnetic reversal directly \"drive\" the operation of the Sun and stars; rather, it is the brightness (luminosity) and rotation that do.\n6. Option 1: \"चमकदार और प्लाज्मा प्रवाह\" (luminosity and plasma flow) – plasma flow is not mentioned as a driver, but as related to Rossby number.\n7. Option 2: \"रॉसी नंबर, रोटेशन और मैग्नेटिक रिवर्सल\" (Rossby number, rotation, and magnetic reversal) – Rossby number and magnetic reversal are not the drivers.\n8. Option 3: \"रोटेशन और चमकदार\" (rotation and luminosity) – matches the passage exactly.\n9. Option 4: \"चमकदारता, रॉस्बी संख्या और रोटेशन\" (luminosity, Rossby number, and rotation) – includes Rossby number, which is not a driver but a measurement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the similarities and differences between virtual (वर्चुअल) teams and traditional (परंपरागत) teams.\n2. It states that virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams (\"वर्चुअल टीमों को भी परंपरागत टीमों की तरह ही उत्कृष्टता के समान मानकों पर रखा जाता है\").\n3. It then describes differences: virtual team members often act as contact points for their local groups, have more freedom, and may work across different time zones.\n4. The passage also mentions the concept of an \"invisible team\" (अदृश्य टीम) that sets standards for each member, which is a unique component of virtual teams.\n5. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Both teams are expected to perform at the same level of excellence. This matches the passage.\n   - Option 2: Both teams work independently to varying degrees in day-to-day activities. The passage says virtual teams have more freedom, implying a difference, not a similarity.\n   - Option 3: Both teams report to an invisible management team. The passage says this is unique to virtual teams.\n   - Option 4: Both teams work in the same time zone. The passage says virtual teams may work in different time zones, unlike traditional teams.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the traditional medieval castle and how it has inspired imagination. It mentions images of \"jousts\" (जत्थों), \"banquets\" (भोजों), and \"Arthurian chivalry\" (आर्थरियन शिष्टता).\n2. It describes standing among thousand-year-old ruins and imagining the sounds and smells of long-past battles, the clatter of hooves on coals, and the fear rising from the dungeons (कालकोठरी).\n3. The passage then questions whether our imagination is based on reality and asks why castles were built and how they were designed.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. कालकोठरी के गड्ढे (dungeon pits): The passage mentions \"कालकोठरी\" (dungeons) and the fear rising from them, so this is mentioned.\n2. जोउस्ट्स (jousts): The passage mentions \"जत्थों,\" which refers to jousts, so this is mentioned.\n3. क्षात्रधर्म (chivalry): The passage mentions \"आर्थरियन शिष्टता,\" which refers to Arthurian chivalry, so this is mentioned.\n4. शूरवीर (warriors/heroes): The passage does not mention \"शूरवीर\" (warriors/heroes) directly. It talks about battles, chivalry, and jousts, but not specifically about warriors or heroes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that is NOT mentioned in the passage, which is option 4.\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the conflict in 1994 where the ethnic Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region waged war against the Azeris.\n2. With Armenian support, a new republic (गणराज्य) was created.\n3. However, the passage clearly states that \"no established nation - not even Armenia - officially recognizes it.\"\n4. The \"it\" here refers to the new republic that was created.\n5. The question asks: \"What is not recognized by Armenia?\"\n6. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Nagorno-Karabakh area – The passage does not say the area itself is unrecognized, but rather the new republic.\n   - Option 2: War against Azeris – The passage does not mention recognition of the war.\n   - Option 3: Azerbaijan's diplomatic arguments – Not relevant to recognition.\n   - Option 4: The new republic – This matches the passage, as it is explicitly stated that even Armenia does not officially recognize the new republic.\n\nFinal answer:\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a situation where passengers were given water because they were waiting in 90-degree Fahrenheit heat.\n2. It mentions that Fire Captain Scott Konus said, “With temperatures in the 90s, it was a hot day in Santa Clara.”\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, who commented on the uncomfortable temperature?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Ride operator – The passage does not mention the ride operator making any comment about the temperature.\n   - Option 2: Fire Captain – The passage specifically quotes Fire Captain Scott Konus commenting on the temperature.\n   - Option 3: Passenger – No passenger is quoted or mentioned as commenting on the temperature.\n   - Option 4: Police Chief – The police chief is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains that when hydrogen atoms fuse to form heavier elements (fusion), energy is released.\n2. This released energy is what allows stars to emit light and heat.\n3. The passage also mentions that scientists are trying to build reactors that can produce energy in the same way, but this is a difficult problem.\n4. The question asks: According to the passage, what does fusion allow stars to do?\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Make heavy elements\" – While fusion does create heavier elements, the passage specifically says the energy from this process is what allows stars to emit light and heat.\n   - Option 2: \"Make fusion reactors\" – This is about scientists, not stars.\n   - Option 3: \"Give light and heat\" – The passage directly states that the energy from fusion is what allows stars to provide light and heat.\n   - Option 4: \"Make hydrogen atoms\" – Fusion uses hydrogen atoms, it does not make them.\n\nThe correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that traditionally, the heir to the throne would go into the army after finishing school.\n2. However, Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology, archaeology, and later history.\n3. He received a 2:2 (lower second class degree).\n4. He was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a degree.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Based on the given information, what did Charles do first?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Join the army before finishing school – The passage says traditionally this was done, but Charles did not do this.\n2. Study archaeology – The passage says he studied anthropology, archaeology, and history at university, but this happened after he went to university.\n3. Earn a degree – He earned a degree, but before that, he had to attend college and study.\n4. Attend Trinity College – The passage says he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied those subjects and then earned a degree.\n\nSo, the first thing Charles did (from the options) was attend Trinity College.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n4",
      "Step 1: Understand the passage  \nThe passage explains the concept of \"स्कैफ़ोल्डिंग\" (scaffolding) in learning. Scaffolding is not a method of learning itself, but rather a support system for people learning something new. Scaffolds can be real (like a teacher) or virtual (like the Microsoft Office paperclip assistant). Virtual scaffolds are built into software and help by asking questions, giving hints, or providing information about processes that are challenging for the learner to handle alone.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options  \n1. कंप्यूटर गेम की शुरुआत में ट्यूटोरियल (A tutorial at the start of a computer game)  \n   - This is a virtual scaffold, as it helps the learner understand how to play the game.\n\n2. एसऐटी ट्यूटर (SAT tutor)  \n   - This is a real scaffold, as a tutor helps the student learn and provides support.\n\n3. स्वतंत्र अध्ययन कार्यक्रम (Independent study program)  \n   - This is a program where the student studies independently, without direct support or scaffolding.\n\n4. छोटा लीग कोच (Little league coach)  \n   - This is a real scaffold, as the coach helps and guides the players.\n\nStep 3: Identify which is NOT an example of scaffolding  \nOptions 1, 2, and 4 all provide some form of support or guidance to the learner, fitting the definition of scaffolding. Option 3, \"स्वतंत्र अध्ययन कार्यक्रम\" (independent study program), does not provide such support; the learner is on their own.\n\nFinal answer:\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the appeal and practicality of traveling long distances in one's own car. It mentions that, unlike large vehicles, you are already familiar with your own car and know its limitations.\n2. It also states that using your own car for road trips is a great way to travel, and sometimes the car itself can serve as a \"camp.\"\n3. The passage specifically notes that if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon with seats that can be folded down, car camping is possible.\n4. The question asks: According to the passage, what would be helpful for a car stay planner?\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Knowing the car and its limitations well\" — The passage mentions that you are already used to driving your car and know its limits, which is helpful.\n   - Option 2: \"A vehicle with foldable seats\" — The passage says that if you have a vehicle with seats that can be folded down, car camping is possible, which is directly helpful for planning a stay in the car.\n   - Option 3: \"Tent\" — The passage mentions that pitching a tent on private property or in any city can attract unnecessary attention, implying it's not always helpful.\n   - Option 4: \"You must have private property to set up camp\" — The passage says that setting up a tent on private property can attract attention, but does not say it's necessary or helpful for car camping.\n\n6. The most directly helpful thing for planning a stay in the car, according to the passage, is having a vehicle with foldable seats, as it makes car camping possible.\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes two main types of tourism: recreational tourism (for fun and relaxation, such as beaches, theme parks, campgrounds) and cultural tourism (where the purpose is to learn about the history and culture of a place).\n2. The question asks: \"A visit to a museum falls under which type of tourism?\"\n3. Museums are places where people go to learn about history, art, and culture.\n4. According to the passage, if the purpose of travel is to learn about the history and culture of a place, it is called \"cultural tourism.\"\n5. Therefore, visiting a museum is an example of cultural tourism.\n\nThe correct option is:\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage is about a US Navy ship, specifically an Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship.\n2. The passage mentions that the US Navy is investigating an incident and is working on the best ways to safely extract the crew.\n3. The ship was on its way to Puerto Princesa in Palawan.\n4. It has been assigned to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet and is based in Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan.\n5. The question asks: \"According to the sentence, which country thought of taking the captive fighter's meal?\" (However, this question seems a bit out of context, possibly due to a translation error. But the options are about the ship's location, type, and assignment.)\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n1. \"It was on the way to Puerto Princesa\" – This is a route, not a country or an assignment.\n2. \"It is located in Palawan\" – The passage says it was on the way to Palawan, not located there.\n3. \"It is a mine countermeasures ship\" – This is about the type of ship, not about a country or assignment.\n4. \"Assigned to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet\" – The passage clearly states this.\n\nGiven the passage, the only option that directly matches the information is option 4: The ship is assigned to the US Navy's Seventh Fleet.\n\nFinal answer:\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage talks about the city of Sintra, describing it as romantic and attractive.\n2. It specifically mentions that Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron recorded his wonderful adventures there.\n3. The passage does not say that Sintra is recognized because of Cabo da Roca (option 1), nor does it mention \"Marian magic presence\" (option 2) as the reason for its fame among foreigners.\n4. Option 4, \"it is a romantic epic,\" is not directly stated as the reason for its recognition among foreigners.\n5. The passage clearly states that Lord Byron's positive accounts made Sintra famous among foreigners.\n\nCorrect option:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that Mitt Romney won the Florida Republican primary with 46% of the vote.\n2. It mentions that Florida is a \"winner-takes-all\" state, meaning the winner gets all the delegates.\n3. Specifically, it says Florida awarded all its 50 delegates to Romney.\n4. The question asks: \"Since Florida was a winner-takes-all state, what was given to Mitt Romney?\"\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"32 delegates of the state\" – Incorrect, as the passage says all 50 delegates, not 32.\n   - Option 2: \"Republican Party nomination\" – Incorrect, he became a strong contender, but did not get the nomination yet.\n   - Option 3: \"Delegates of all states\" – Incorrect, he only got Florida's delegates, not all states.\n   - Option 4: \"46 percent votes\" – Incorrect, he got 46% of the votes, but the question asks what he was given because Florida was winner-takes-all, which refers to delegates, not votes.\n\nNone of the options exactly say \"all 50 delegates,\" but option 3 is closest in wording, but it says \"all states' delegates,\" which is not correct. Option 1 says \"32 delegates,\" which is also incorrect. Option 4 is about votes, not delegates. Option 2 is about the nomination, which he did not get yet.\n\nHowever, based on the passage, the correct answer should be \"all of the state's delegates,\" but since none of the options match exactly, and option 1 is the only one mentioning delegates (even though the number is wrong), it is the closest.\n\nBut strictly by the passage, none are fully correct. However, in multiple-choice questions, you pick the closest correct answer.\n\nOption 1 is the only one that refers to delegates, which is what he was awarded.\n\n1",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses \"up bow\" and \"down bow\" marks in music notation for string instruments.\n2. \"Up bow\" mark looks like a 'V', and \"down bow\" mark looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom.\n3. \"Up bow\" means you start from the tip and push the bow downwards; \"down bow\" means you start from the frog (the part you hold) and pull the bow.\n4. An \"up bow\" (ऊपरी-चाप) usually produces a soft sound (मृदु ध्वनि).\n5. A \"down bow\" (निचला-चाप) produces a strong and more pronounced sound (मजबूत और अधिक मुखर).\n6. The passage also mentions respecting printed bowing marks for musical reasons.\n\nNow, let's look at the options and see which one does NOT relate to \"pulling the bow\" (i.e., \"down bow\"):\n\n1. नरम ध्वनि (Soft sound) – The passage says \"up bow\" produces a soft sound, not \"down bow.\" So this is NOT related to \"down bow.\"\n2. निशान एक टैबलेट उत्तेजना की तरह होगा (The mark will look like a tablet/staple) – The passage says the \"down bow\" mark looks like a staple, so this IS related to \"down bow.\"\n3. मजबूत आवाज (Strong sound) – The passage says \"down bow\" produces a strong sound, so this IS related to \"down bow.\"\n4. मेंढक से शुरू (Start from the frog) – The passage says \"down bow\" starts from the frog, so this IS related to \"down bow.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that is NOT related to \"down bow,\" which is option 1 (soft sound).\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the tropical cyclone Gonu, mentioning that at its peak, it reached wind speeds of 240 km/h (149 mph).\n2. It also states that at the beginning of the day, the winds were about 83 km/h and it was expected to remain weak.\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, when was the tropical cyclone Gonu expected to weaken?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Before reaching Maldives – The passage does not mention anything about reaching Maldives or weakening before that.\n   - Option 2: When wind speed dropped to about 83 km/h – The passage says at the beginning of the day, winds were 83 km/h and it was expected to remain weak, not that it weakened when it dropped to 83 km/h.\n   - Option 3: Before reaching its peak – The passage says it was expected to remain weak when the winds were 83 km/h, i.e., before it reached its peak. This matches the information in the passage.\n   - Option 4: Before reaching 149 mph wind speed – The passage does not say it was expected to weaken before reaching 149 mph, but rather that it was expected to remain weak when it was much lower.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes an outbreak of a disease that starts in pigs and is transmitted to humans via mosquitoes.\n2. The government has taken several measures:\n   - Deploying pig catchers in severely affected areas.\n   - Distributing thousands of mosquito nets.\n   - Spraying insecticides.\n   - Promising several million vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies next year.\n3. It is mentioned that the delivery of vaccines to the most affected areas has been delayed due to lack of funds and lower priority compared to other diseases.\n\nNow, the question asks: According to the passage, which preventive measure will be implemented last?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n1. Insecticides (कीटनाशकों) – The passage says spraying is already being done.\n2. Pig catchers (सुअर पकड़ने वाले) – Already deployed.\n3. Encephalitis vaccines (एन्सेफलाइटिस के टीके) – The passage says these will be available next year and their delivery has been delayed.\n4. Mosquito nets (मच्छरदानी) – Already distributed.\n\nFrom the passage, the only measure that is specifically mentioned as being delayed and will be implemented in the future (next year) is the vaccine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the importance of proper nutrition, maintaining a healthy energy balance, effective hydration habits, and understanding supplementation for young athletes.\n2. It states that while proper nutrition alone cannot produce elite performance, it can significantly impact overall health.\n3. The passage specifically mentions that maintaining a healthy energy balance, effective hydration, and understanding supplementation can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy their sport more.\n4. The question asks which of the following is NOT recommended as a way for young athletes to enjoy their sport more.\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Practicing proper nutrition – This is recommended in the passage.\n   - Option 2: Consistently performing at an elite level – The passage says proper nutrition alone cannot produce elite performance, and it does not recommend this as a way to enjoy the sport more.\n   - Option 3: Hydrating effectively – This is recommended in the passage.\n   - Option 4: Maintaining a healthy energy balance – This is also recommended in the passage.\n6. Therefore, the only option not recommended as a way to enjoy the sport more is \"consistently performing at an elite level.\"\n\nAnswer:\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the importance of endurance (सहन-शक्ति) over speed (गति) as the race distance increases from a quarter mile to half a mile.\n2. It states that while a first-class half-mile runner must have considerable speed, developing endurance to face all dangers is essential.\n3. The passage also mentions that some cross-country running in winter and gym work for upper body strength are good preparations, but the main focus is on endurance.\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1 talks about running cross-country in winter, which is mentioned as good preparation, but not as the most important thing.\n   - Option 2 says \"developing endurance rather than speed,\" which matches the main point of the passage.\n   - Option 3 is about winning in two minutes, which is not the main focus.\n   - Option 4 says \"developing speed rather than endurance,\" which is the opposite of what the passage says.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the difficulty for primates with human-like digestive systems to meet their amino acid (protein) requirements from plants available in the savanna.\n2. It mentions that failing to meet these requirements can lead to serious consequences like depression, malnutrition, and even death.\n3. The passage states that while leaves and legumes (beans) are the most easily available plant sources of protein, they are hard to digest for primates like us unless cooked.\n4. In contrast, animal foods such as ants, termites, and eggs are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality protein with all essential amino acids.\n5. The passage suggests that our ancestors may have solved their \"protein problem\" similarly to how chimpanzees do today—by eating animal foods.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. Dried leaves – Plant source, hard to digest, not recommended.\n2. Raw legumes – Plant source, hard to digest without cooking, not recommended.\n3. Grasshoppers (टिड्डे) – Animal source, easily digestible, high-quality protein, recommended by the passage.\n4. Flower stems – Plant source, not mentioned as a good protein source.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how long-distance calls (thousands of miles away) are made using satellites. The call is sent to a satellite in space, which then reflects it back down to Earth.\n2. The passage also mentions telescopes (दूरबीन) used by scientists in space, but this is for observing, not for calls.\n3. Rockets (रॉकेट्स) are used to send satellites and telescopes into space, but they are not involved in reflecting calls.\n4. \"दीपक\" (lamp) is not relevant to the context of calls or space technology.\n5. The correct answer should be the object that receives the call in space and reflects it back to Earth, which is the satellite (उपग्रह).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the gravitational pull on Io (a moon of Jupiter) compared to Earth.\n2. It states that if a person weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth, they would weigh only 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io.\n3. This means the gravitational force on Io is much less than on Earth.\n4. The passage concludes that gravity on Io exerts less attraction on you than Earth's gravity.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"Io's gravitational force will pull you less than Earth's gravity.\"  \n   - This matches the passage exactly.\n\n2. \"The greater the gravitational force of Io, the less your weight becomes.\"  \n   - This is incorrect; greater gravity would mean more weight, not less.\n\n3. \"When less gravitational force pulls more, your weight increases.\"  \n   - This is contradictory and incorrect.\n\n4. \"Io's gravitational force will pull you more than Earth's gravity.\"  \n   - This is the opposite of what the passage says.\n\nThe correct answer is option 1.\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes Victoria Falls, its location, and the best times to visit depending on what travelers want to experience.\n2. It mentions that during the rainy season (November to March), the water volume is high, making the falls more attractive, but the view of the actual waterfall becomes obscured due to all the water.\n3. It also says that if you walk near the falls or cross the bridge during this time, you will get wet, and the view will be unclear because of the high water volume.\n4. The question asks: When should travelers visit the falls if they are looking for \"unobstructed views\"?\n5. From the passage, \"unobstructed views\" would be possible when the water volume is not too high, i.e., outside the rainy season, because during the rainy season, the view is obscured.\n6. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: November to March (rainy season, high water, view is obscured) – Not correct.\n   - Option 2: During tourist season (not specified in the passage, so not directly supported).\n   - Option 3: When water volume is high (view is obscured) – Not correct.\n   - Option 4: Outside the rainy season (when water volume is lower, so views are clearer) – This matches the passage's implication.\n\nFinal answer:\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the Il-76 aircraft, which has been a main component of the Russian and Soviet armies since the 1970s.\n2. It mentions that just last month, there was a serious accident involving the Il-76 in Russia.\n3. Specifically, on October 7, during takeoff, the engine separated from the aircraft, but there was no damage.\n4. After this accident, Russia grounded (suspended the use of) the Il-76s for some time.\n5. The question asks: \"For what reason did Russia suspend the use of Il-76s?\"\n6. Looking at the options:\n   - 1. Internal troops (not relevant to the suspension)\n   - 2. Accident (the passage clearly states the suspension was after an accident)\n   - 3. Soviet army (historical context, not a reason for suspension)\n   - 4. Pending investigation (a committee was formed, but the passage says the suspension was after the accident, not specifically due to the investigation)\n\nThe most direct and correct reason, as per the passage, is the accident.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that Kirby Muxloe Castle, for its time, was more of a strong house than a real castle.\n2. It mentions that its large bright windows and thin walls would not be able to withstand a prolonged attack.\n3. When Lord Hastings started its construction in 1480, the country was relatively peaceful.\n4. The need for defense was only against small groups of wandering troublemakers.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. \"The strong walls of the castle were built at Lord Hastings' request.\"  \n   - The passage says the walls were thin, not strong. This is incorrect.\n\n2. \"During construction, the peace in the country required minimal security.\"  \n   - The passage says the country was peaceful and only minimal defense was needed. This matches the passage.\n\n3. \"The construction of the castle was not similar to that period.\"  \n   - The passage does not compare the construction to other castles of the period, only that it was more like a strong house than a real castle.\n\n4. \"It was built in such a way that it was tall and strong and could withstand long attacks.\"  \n   - The passage says the opposite: it could not withstand prolonged attacks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage is about a hockey match between Washington Capitals and Atlanta Thrashers.\n2. Alex Ovechkin (एलेक्स ओवेचकिन) is highlighted for his performance: he scored 2 goals and made 2 assists.\n3. It is mentioned that \"उस रात रूकी निकल्स बैकस्ट्रॉम के खेल जिताने वाले गोल से ओवेचकिन को सबसे पहली मदद मिली.\" This translates to: \"That night, Ovechkin got his first assist on rookie Nicklas Backstrom's game-winning goal.\"\n4. The passage further discusses Ovechkin's achievements, but the question is specifically about who scored the game-winning goal for Washington Capitals in that match.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. निकलास बैकस्ट्रॉम (Nicklas Backstrom)\n2. जैरोमिर जागर (Jaromir Jagr)\n3. मारियो लेमीक्स (Mario Lemieux)\n4. एलेक्स ओवेच्किन (Alex Ovechkin)\n\nFrom the passage, it is clear that Nicklas Backstrom scored the game-winning goal.\n\nFinal answer:\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the diet of Triceratops, specifically mentioning their ability to crush not only leaves but also tough branches and roots.\n2. It is mentioned that some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, a type of plant common in the Cretaceous period, which looked like a small palm tree with spiky crowns and thorny leaves.\n3. The passage states that Triceratops could break off leaves and twigs from the plant with their powerful beaks before eating the trunk.\n4. There is a debate among scientists about whether Triceratops could eat cycads, as these plants are considered poisonous, but some modern animals can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.\n5. The question asks which part of the cycad plant Triceratops was likely to eat.\n6. The options are: spiky leaves, trunk, root, or fruit.\n7. The passage specifically mentions that Triceratops could break off leaves and twigs before eating the trunk, and their teeth could crush leaves, tough branches, and roots.\n8. However, the passage emphasizes the act of breaking off leaves and twigs, and the spiky leaves are described in detail.\n\nBased on this, the most likely answer is \"spiky leaves.\"\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses traveling across the Northern Baltic in winter, mentioning that one must check the cabin area because people who are more sensitive will experience a lot of noise when passing through ice.\n2. It also mentions that in St. Petersburg, spending time in the city is included, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (with conditions).\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, if a passenger's cruise is in the summer, what might they be able to avoid?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: Spending time in the city – The passage does not say this is avoidable in summer.\n   - Option 2: Passing through ice – The passage specifically mentions noise from passing through ice in winter, implying that in summer, there would be no ice to pass through.\n   - Option 3: Visa requirements – The passage says cruise passengers are exempt, regardless of season.\n   - Option 4: St. Petersburg – The passage does not say this is avoidable in summer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a tennis match involving \"मरे\" (Murray) and \"डेल पोत्रो\" (Del Potro).\n2. In the first set, after both men held their serves, Murray won the set in a tie-breaker.\n3. In the second set, Del Potro had an advantage at the start, but again the set reached 6-6, requiring another tie-break.\n4. The key sentence is: \"पोट्रो ने इस पॉइंट पर अपने कंधे का इलाज करवाया लेकिन खेल में वापसी करने में कामयाब रहे.\" This means \"At this point, Potro got treatment for his shoulder but managed to return to the game.\"\n5. \"इस पॉइंट पर\" refers to the moment after the second set reached 6-6, i.e., during the second set, before or around the second tie-break.\n6. Now, let's look at the options:\n   - Option 1: During the first set (not correct, as the treatment happened later).\n   - Option 2: Before the first tie-break (not correct, as the treatment happened in the second set).\n   - Option 3: During the second set (correct, as the passage says he got treatment after the second set reached 6-6).\n   - Option 4: After the third tie-break (not mentioned in the passage).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the effects of alcohol and emphasizes the importance of knowing one's limits.\n2. It mentions that excessive drinking can cause long-term health issues such as liver damage, blindness, and even death.\n3. The passage specifically warns about the dangers of illegally produced alcohol, which may contain harmful impurities like methanol. Even small amounts of methanol can cause blindness or death.\n4. The passage suggests that being aware of your own limit and drinking in moderation is important to avoid these harmful effects.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. Drinking alcohol with methanol – The passage says methanol is dangerous and can cause blindness or death, so this would not reduce harmful effects.\n2. Drinking illegally produced alcohol – The passage warns that this increases the risk, so this would not reduce harmful effects.\n3. Drinking alcohol in small quantities – The passage emphasizes knowing your limit and drinking in moderation to avoid harmful effects, so this would reduce harmful effects.\n4. Drinking with different people – The passage does not mention anything about the company you keep affecting the harmful effects.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses earthquake and volcanic activity in Iceland.\n2. It mentions that the US Geological Survey did not show any earthquakes in Iceland in the week before.\n3. The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla region in the last 48 hours.\n4. The key sentence is: \"तेज़ भूकंप गतिविधि के परिणामस्वरूप स्थिति परिवर्तन 10 मार्च को ज्वालामुखी के शिखर कालडेरा के उत्तर-पूर्व की ओर हुआ था.\"  \n   Translation: \"As a result of intense earthquake activity, a change in situation occurred on March 10 to the northeast of the volcano's summit caldera.\"\n5. The question asks: \"According to the passage, when did the change in situation occur?\"\n6. The passage clearly states that the change occurred on March 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses the concept of time and how it affects everything we do, yet is difficult to understand.\n2. It mentions that time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years.\n3. We experience time as a sequence of events moving from the future, through the present, to the past.\n4. Time is also described as how we compare the duration (length) of events.\n5. Importantly, the passage says that by observing the repetition of cyclical (चक्रीय) events, we can mark the passage of time. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly, again and again.\n\nNow, let's look at the question:\n\"समय बीतने से क्या देखा और दर्शाया जा सकता है, एक सर्पिल घटना जो खुद को दोहराती है?\"\nTranslation: \"What can be seen and indicated by the passage of time, a cyclical event that repeats itself?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. अवधि (Duration) – This means the length of time something lasts.\n2. दुहराव (Repetition) – This means something happening again and again.\n3. चाहना (Desire) – This means wanting something.\n4. कठिनाई (Difficulty) – This means hardship or challenge.\n\nThe passage specifically says that by observing the repetition of cyclical events, we can mark the passage of time. The key word here is \"repetition\" (दुहराव), as cyclical events are defined by their repeated occurrence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage talks about a document that refers to the border dispute, specifically mentioning that Palestine wants borders based on those before the 1967 Middle East war.\n2. Other topics reportedly included in the document are the future status of Jerusalem (which is holy to both countries) and the issue of the Jordan Valley.\n3. It also mentions that after any agreement, Israel wants to maintain the current military situation for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority (PA) agrees to maintain it for only five years.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. यरुशलम की भविष्य (The future of Jerusalem)  \n   - The passage says the future status of Jerusalem is included. So, this is included.\n\n2. 1967 के युद्ध का कारण (The cause of the 1967 war)  \n   - The passage mentions the 1967 war as a reference point for borders, but does NOT discuss the cause of the war. So, this is NOT included.\n\n3. घाटी में सैन्य स्थिति गई है (The military situation in the valley)  \n   - The passage discusses the military situation, especially in the Jordan Valley, and how long it should be maintained. So, this is included.\n\n4. सीमा विवाद को लेकर है (About the border dispute)  \n   - The passage says the document refers to the border dispute. So, this is included.\n\nTherefore, the only issue NOT included in the document, according to the passage, is the cause of the 1967 war.\n\nFinal answer:\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says that President Minister Rodrigo Arias was found infected with a mild type of Arias virus.\n2. His condition is stable, but he will remain in isolation at home for several days.\n3. Arias himself says, \"Apart from fever and sore throat, I feel well and in good condition so that I can complete my work by telecommuting. I hope to resume all my responsibilities by Monday.\"\n4. Now, let's look at the options:\n\nOption 1: \"He does not have any fever.\"  \n- This is incorrect. The passage says he has fever and sore throat.\n\nOption 2: \"He will stay at home for several weeks.\"  \n- This is incorrect. The passage says \"several days,\" not weeks.\n\nOption 3: \"He thought that working from home is enough.\"  \n- This is partially correct. The passage says he feels well enough to work from home (telecommuting) and hopes to resume all responsibilities by Monday. This matches the idea that he considers working from home sufficient during his illness.\n\nOption 4: \"He is infected with a severe virus.\"  \n- This is incorrect. The passage says he is infected with a mild type of the virus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes that Johnny Reid drove the A1GP car \"Black Beauty\" over the Auckland Harbour Bridge at speeds exceeding 160 km/h, making history.\n2. It is mentioned that due to the small size of the car, the New Zealand police had difficulty measuring his speed with a radar gun.\n3. The crucial sentence is: \"पुलिस उनकी रफ़्तार सिर्फ़ तभी माप सकी, जब वे रफ़्तार कम करके 160 किलोमीटर/घंटा पर आ गए थे.\"  \n   Translation: \"The police could only measure his speed when he slowed down to 160 km/h.\"\n4. This means the police were only able to use their radar gun to measure his speed when he was driving at exactly 160 km/h, not above it or at any other specific instance (like the seventh time or the first time on the bridge).\n\nNow, let's match this with the options:\n1. While he was driving at 160 km/h — This matches the passage.\n2. On his seventh time over the bridge — Not mentioned as relevant.\n3. While he was driving above 160 km/h — The passage says the police could NOT measure at higher speeds.\n4. The first time on the bridge — Not mentioned as relevant.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes the unique steep slopes and valleys of Norway, which suddenly form high, more or less flat plateaus. These plateaus are often referred to as \"चौड़ाई\" (broadness), meaning a wide, open space.\n2. In the regions of Rogaland and Agder, these plateaus are commonly called \"हेई\" (hei), which means barren marshy land, often covered with heather.\n3. The question asks: What is different about the plateaus in Rogaland or Agder compared to the rest of Norway?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"They have trees\" – The passage does not mention trees as a distinguishing feature.\n   - Option 2: \"There is no disturbance\" – The passage does not mention anything about disturbance.\n   - Option 3: \"Platforms are often similar\" – The passage does not say the plateaus are similar.\n   - Option 4: \"They are often covered with heather\" – The passage specifically says that in Rogaland and Agder, the plateaus (hei) are often covered with heather.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the claims made by media companies about \"stopping piracy\" through the use of region codes.\n2. It states that these claims are false, and that region codes do not actually prevent illegal copying (piracy).\n3. The passage explains that a bit-for-bit copy of a disc will work the same on any device, regardless of region code, so region codes do not stop copying.\n4. The real purpose, according to the passage, is to give companies more control over their markets, i.e., to control where and how their products are sold and used.\n5. The passage concludes that this is all about making more money (\"पैसे कताई है\").\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n1. \"To copy the disc\" – The passage says region codes do not help with copying.\n2. \"To provide complete control over the market\" – The passage says the real purpose is to give companies more control over their markets.\n3. \"To stop the region\" – This does not make sense in context.\n4. \"To do illegal copying\" – The passage says region codes do not help with illegal copying.\n\nThe correct answer is option 2.\n\n2",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the events after the adoption of a document by Congress on July 4.\n2. The handwritten draft was signed by John Hancock and Charles Thomson.\n3. After signing, the document was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop, which was a few blocks away.\n4. At John Dunlap's printing shop, between 150 and 200 copies were printed at night. These printed copies are known as \"Dunlap Broadsides.\"\n5. The passage then describes where some of these copies were sent and read (e.g., to George Washington in New York, to London, public reading at Independence Hall).\n6. The question asks: \"From which of the following places did the Dunlap Broadside originate?\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n1. New York – The passage says a copy was sent there, not that it originated there.\n2. Dunlap's printing shop – The passage clearly states that the copies were printed at John Dunlap's printing shop.\n3. London – A copy was sent there, but it did not originate there.\n4. Independence Hall – The public reading happened here, but the broadsides were not printed here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the place where the broadsides were actually printed: Dunlap's printing shop.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning (in English):\n\n1. The passage explains that moose (also called elk) are not naturally aggressive but will defend themselves if they feel threatened.\n2. It also mentions that people sometimes do not consider moose to be very dangerous, so they come too close and put themselves at risk.\n3. The question asks: What should people avoid doing with moose?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"अनजान होना चाहिए\" (Should be unaware) — This does not directly relate to the passage's warning.\n   - Option 2: \"धीरे आ रहा है\" (Coming slowly) — The passage does not mention the speed of approach as a problem.\n   - Option 3: \"उनके खतरे के स्तर को कम करने के लिए\" (To underestimate their danger level) — The passage specifically warns that people underestimate the danger of moose and get too close, which puts them at risk.\n   - Option 4: \"दूर से उन्हें देखना होगा\" (Should watch them from a distance) — This is actually a recommended action, not something to avoid.\n\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is option 3, as people should avoid underestimating the danger level of moose.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes \"जार्डिन डे ला यूनियन\" (Jardin de la Union).\n2. It says this place was originally built as an atrium for a 17th-century convent, of which only the \"Templo de San Diego\" remains.\n3. Now, it functions as a central plaza with many activities day and night.\n4. There are many restaurants around the garden.\n5. In the central park gazebo, free music programs are often held in the afternoon and evening.\n6. \"Callejon del Beso\" (Alley of the Kiss) is mentioned as a place with two balconies very close to each other, associated with an old love story, and children tell the story for a small fee.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n1. संगीत कार्यक्रमों के साथ एक केंद्रीय गज़ेबो (A central gazebo with music programs): The passage mentions this directly.\n2. पुराने रोमांटिक किंवदंती का जन्मस्थान (Birthplace of an old romantic legend): The passage mentions \"Callejon del Beso\" as the home of an old love story, but it is not clear if this is inside Jardin de la Union or a separate place. However, the passage lists it as a separate location after describing Jardin de la Union.\n3. बगीचे के चारों ओर बहुत सारे रेस्तरां (Many restaurants around the garden): The passage mentions this directly.\n4. पुरानी कॉन्वेंट इमारत (Old convent building): The passage says only the \"Templo de San Diego\" remains from the convent; the old convent building itself does not exist anymore.\n\nSo, the correct answer is the one that is NOT found in Jardin de la Union. Option 4 is correct because the old convent building no longer exists; only the church remains.\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage talks about famous Greek personalities, including Homer, Sophocles, Aristophanes, and Pythagoras.\n2. It specifically mentions Homer as \"महान अंधे कवि\" which translates to \"the great blind poet.\"\n3. The passage says Homer created two masterpieces: the Iliad and the Odyssey.\n4. The question asks: \"What could the Greek poet Homer not do?\"\n5. The options are:\n   1. सुनना (hear)\n   2. देखना (see)\n   3. चलना (walk)\n   4. बात करना (speak)\n6. Since the passage calls Homer \"blind,\" it means he could not see.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how courier companies are paid to deliver items quickly and efficiently, especially important business documents, goods, or spare parts.\n2. It mentions that large companies may have their own planes for select routes, but for other routes and smaller firms, sending items can be problematic.\n3. If items are sent via air freight, unloading and customs can take several days.\n4. The only way to get items quickly is to send them as checked baggage.\n5. However, airline rules do not allow checked baggage to be sent without a passenger, and this is where \"you\" (the reader) come in—to accompany the delivery.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"When things are sent via air freight\" – The passage says this method is slow due to customs and unloading, not that a companion is needed.\n2. \"When the company uses its own planes\" – The passage says large companies do this for select routes, but does not mention the need for a companion.\n3. \"When sending checked baggage\" – The passage specifically says that checked baggage cannot be sent without a passenger, so a companion is needed.\n4. \"When a large company handles the delivery\" – The passage does not mention this as a reason for needing a companion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage says that Hu stated they will try to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by a significant margin from 2005 to 2020. This means he mentioned the **basis for reduction** (economic output/GDP) and the **timeframe** (2005 to 2020).\n2. It is also mentioned that Hu did **not specify any figure** for the reduction. So, he did not give a specific number or percentage.\n3. Hu encouraged developing countries to avoid polluting in the old ways and then cleaning up later. This is **advice to developing countries regarding pollution**.\n4. However, while a timeframe (2005 to 2020) is mentioned, the passage does **not specify an exact date** when the expected reduction will be achieved—just a range.\n5. The question asks: \"What was NOT mentioned by Hu?\"\n\nNow, let's match the options:\n1. \"कटौती का आधार\" (Basis for reduction): This was mentioned (GDP/economic output).\n2. \"प्रदूषण के संबंध में विकासशील देशों को सलाह\" (Advice to developing countries about pollution): This was mentioned.\n3. \"एक तारीख जब कार्बन उत्सर्जन में उम्मीद से कटौती होगी\" (A date when the expected reduction in carbon emissions will occur): An exact date was NOT mentioned, only a range (2005-2020).\n4. \"कार्बन उत्सर्जन में कटौती का एक आंकड़ा\" (A figure for the reduction in carbon emissions): It is explicitly stated that no figure was given.\n\nBut the question is about what was NOT mentioned. Both option 3 (exact date) and option 4 (figure) were not mentioned, but the passage specifically says that no figure was given, while a timeframe (2005-2020) is mentioned, which is a period, not a specific date.\n\nHowever, the question is about what was NOT mentioned at all. The passage says: \"उन्होंने कटौती के लिए कोई आँकड़ा निर्धारित नहीं किया\" (He did not specify any figure for the reduction). So, the absence of a figure is explicitly mentioned.\n\nBut option 3 asks about a specific date, which is not mentioned at all—only a range is given.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage describes the religious practices of Babylonian people. Each god had a primary temple, considered the god's house.\n2. People brought offerings (sacrifices) for the gods, and priests served the gods by spending time in ceremonies and festivals.\n3. Each temple had an open courtyard (प्रांगण) and an inner sanctum (गर्भगृह) where only priests could enter.\n4. Special pyramid-shaped towers (sometimes called ziggurats) were built as part of the temple, with a special sanctum for the god at the top.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n1. \"मंदिर के प्रांगण में बलि लाना\" — Bringing offerings in the temple courtyard. The passage says people brought offerings, and the courtyard was open, so average citizens could be here.\n2. \"मुख्य मंदिरों में आयोजित समारोहों में भाग लेना\" — Participating in ceremonies in the main temples. The passage says people and priests participated in ceremonies and festivals, so this is possible.\n3. \"मंदिर की छत पर आयोजित उत्सव\" — Festivals held on the temple roof. The passage does not mention anything about festivals on the roof, but it does not explicitly say citizens are forbidden there. However, this is not as clear as the next option.\n4. \"आंतरिक अभयारण्य में बलिदान लाना\" — Bringing offerings into the inner sanctum. The passage clearly states that only priests could enter the inner sanctum (गर्भगृह), so average citizens could not be found here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the place where average Babylonian citizens could NOT be found, which is the inner sanctum.\n\n4",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage explains what happens when a light bulb stops working.\n2. It says that after working for hundreds of hours, the filament of the bulb burns out (\"बल्ब का फिलामेंट जल जाता है\") and then the light bulb stops working (\"इसके बाद लाइट बल्ब काम नहीं करता\").\n3. The passage also discusses safety precautions when changing a bulb, such as turning off the switch or disconnecting the cable, and warns about the risk of electric shock from the metal part of the bulb or socket.\n4. The question asks: According to the passage, what is the reason for the light bulb to stop working?\n5. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"The lamp's switch should be properly turned off\" – This is about safety, not the reason the bulb stops working.\n   - Option 2: \"Electricity flows in the socket where the lamp's metal part is located\" – This is about the risk of electric shock, not why the bulb stops working.\n   - Option 3: \"The filament in the bulb burns out\" – This matches the passage, which says the filament burns out after many hours, causing the bulb to stop working.\n   - Option 4: \"Less electricity flows in the socket\" – The passage does not mention this as a reason.\n\nThe correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses the Dominican Republic, its history, and the people who lived there before European explorers arrived.\n2. It mentions that the island was originally inhabited by the Tainos and Caribs.\n3. The passage specifically states: \"यूरोपीय खोजकर्ताओं के आने के बाद कुछ ही सालों में, स्पेनिश विजेता द्वारा टेनोस की आबादी काफी कम कर दी गई थी.\" This translates to: \"After the arrival of European explorers, within a few years, the population of the Tainos was greatly reduced by the Spanish conquerors.\"\n4. It further says that between 1492 and 1498, based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Tainos.\n5. The question asks: \"According to the passage, after the arrival of explorers, which group's population was most affected?\"\n6. The options are: 1. Haitians, 2. Caribs, 3. The Tainos, 4. Spanish.\n7. Based on the passage, the Tainos' population was specifically mentioned as being greatly reduced after the arrival of explorers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a rugby tournament that started at 10:00 AM with good weather. South Africa, the top seed, started well by defeating Zambia 26-00.\n2. The passage mentions that South Africa appeared weak against their \"Southern Sisters\" (likely other southern African teams), but as the tournament progressed, they improved.\n3. The key sentence is: \"फिर भी लगातार दक्षिण अफ़्रीका ने टूर्नामेंट के आगे बढ़ने पर सुधार किया है,\" which means \"However, South Africa continuously improved as the tournament progressed.\"\n4. Now, let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"सुबह करीब 10:00 बजे\" (Around 10:00 AM) — This is when the tournament started, not when their improvement began.\n   - Option 2: \"बचाव कड़ा करने के बाद\" (After tightening their defense) — The passage mentions their disciplined defense, but does not say improvement started after this.\n   - Option 3: \"जाम्बिया से हारने के बाद\" (After losing to Zambia) — They actually won against Zambia, so this is incorrect.\n   - Option 4: \"जैसे-तैसे टूर्नामेंट चल रहा था\" (As the tournament was progressing) — This matches the passage, which says they improved as the tournament progressed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage discusses genetic variation and mentions two pools: hidden and expressed.\n2. It states that \"mutation adds new genetic variation,\" and \"selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.\"\n3. It also mentions that segregation and recombination shuffle variation between the two pools each generation.\n\nNow, let's look at the question: \"Which process is responsible for adding genetic differences?\"\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. पृथक्करण (Segregation): The passage says this shuffles variation, not adds new variation.\n2. पुनर्संयोजन (Recombination): This also shuffles existing variation, not adds new variation.\n3. उत्परिवर्तन (Mutation): The passage explicitly says \"mutation adds new genetic variation.\"\n4. अभिव्यक्त (Expression): This is not a process that adds variation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let's analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage says Bobek was born in Zagreb, Croatia, and became famous playing for Partizan Belgrade.\n2. He joined Partizan in 1945 and worked/played with them until 1958.\n3. He played 468 matches and scored 403 goals for the team.\n4. No one else has performed or scored more for the club than Bobek.\n5. In 1995, he was chosen as the greatest player in Partizan's history.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. \"उन्होंने 1945 में पार्टिज़न के लिए खेलना शुरू किया\"  \n   Translation: He started playing for Partizan in 1945.  \n   The passage says he joined them in 1945. This is correct.\n\n2. \"वह पार्टिज़न बेलग्रेड से पहले ज़गरेब के लिए खेले\"  \n   Translation: He played for Zagreb before Partizan Belgrade.  \n   The passage only says he was born in Zagreb, not that he played for a Zagreb team before Partizan. This is not supported.\n\n3. \"उन्होंने 1995 तक पार्टिज़न के लिए खेला\"  \n   Translation: He played for Partizan until 1995.  \n   The passage says he played until 1958, not 1995. This is incorrect.\n\n4. \"पार्टिज़न के सर्वश्रेष्ठ खिलाड़ी चुने जाने के बाद उन्हें प्रसिद्धि मिली\"  \n   Translation: He became famous after being chosen as Partizan's best player.  \n   The passage says he became famous while playing for Partizan, and was chosen as the best player in 1995, long after his playing career. This is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage discusses how children quickly become aware of caste and ethnic stereotypes, and these stereotypes influence their behavior.\n2. It gives the example of children from racial minorities who are stereotyped as not performing well in school. When these children become aware of this stereotype, they tend to perform poorly, influenced by the stereotype.\n3. The question asks: According to the passage, which of the following will be affected by a child's knowledge of racial patterns?\n4. Let's analyze the options:\n   - Option 1: \"जातीय अल्पसंख्यक जो पहचाने जाने का विकल्प चुनते हैं\" (Ethnic minorities who choose to be identified) – The passage does not discuss the act of choosing identification.\n   - Option 2: \"उनका व्यवहार\" (Their behavior) – The passage explicitly states that awareness of stereotypes affects behavior.\n   - Option 3: \"अन्य बच्चों के साथ उनके संबंध\" (Their relationships with other children) – The passage does not mention relationships with other children.\n   - Option 4: \"उनकी जाति की परिभाषा\" (The definition of their caste) – The passage does not discuss the definition of caste.\n\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that matches the passage: awareness of stereotypes affects children's behavior.\n\n2",
      "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage states that this is the biggest acquisition in eBay's history.\n2. It mentions regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil, where Skype (the acquired company) is strong.\n3. The passage says the company (eBay) hopes to diversify its sources of profit and gain popularity in these regions.\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1 (\"consolidate its revenue\") is not directly mentioned; the focus is on diversification, not consolidation.\n   - Option 2 (\"expand into new regions\") matches the passage, as it talks about eBay hoping to gain popularity and diversify in regions where Skype is strong.\n   - Option 3 (\"increase its profile\") is somewhat related but not as directly as option 2.\n   - Option 4 (\"satisfy its shareholders\") is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2"
