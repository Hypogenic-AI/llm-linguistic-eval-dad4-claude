      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to determine what will NOT be held in Beijing in 2022.\n\nFrom the passage, I can identify what WILL be held in Beijing:\n- \"Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the indoor ice events\"\n\nSo Beijing will host:\n1. Opening ceremonies ✓\n2. Closing ceremonies ✓ \n3. Indoor ice events ✓\n\nNow let me check what will NOT be held in Beijing:\n- \"Other skiing events will be at the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing\"\n\nThis clearly states that the Taizicheng ski area events will be held in Zhangjiakou, which is 220 km away from Beijing, not in Beijing itself.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Opening ceremonies - WILL be held in Beijing\n2. Taizicheng ski area events - will NOT be held in Beijing (they're in Zhangjiakou)\n3. Closing ceremonies - WILL be held in Beijing\n4. Indoor ice events - WILL be held in Beijing\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to understand how conventional teams and virtual teams are alike.\n\nStep 1: Identify what the passage says about similarities between conventional and virtual teams.\nThe passage begins by stating: \"Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.\"\n\nStep 2: Examine what the passage says about differences between the teams.\nThe passage then goes on to describe several differences:\n- Virtual team members often function as point of contact for their physical group\n- Virtual team members often have MORE autonomy than conventional team members\n- Virtual teams have a unique component called the \"invisible team\" (management team)\n- Virtual teams may meet according to varying time zones\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option against what the passage states:\n\nOption 1: \"Both teams are expected to perform at the same level\"\nThis directly matches the opening statement that both are \"held to the same standards of excellence.\"\n\nOption 2: \"Both teams have varying levels of autonomy\"\nThe passage suggests virtual teams have MORE autonomy than conventional teams, not that both have varying levels.\n\nOption 3: \"Both teams report to an invisible management team\"\nThe passage describes the \"invisible team\" as \"a unique component of a virtual team,\" suggesting this is not shared with conventional teams.\n\nOption 4: \"Both teams function in the same time zone\"\nThe passage mentions varying time zones as a characteristic of virtual teams, implying conventional teams don't have this issue.\n\nThe only similarity explicitly stated is that both types of teams are held to the same standards of excellence.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to identify what is mentioned and what is not mentioned regarding medieval castles.\n\nWhat the passage mentions about medieval castles:\n- Jousts (explicitly mentioned: \"conjuring up images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian chivalry\")\n- Banquets (mentioned in the same phrase as jousts)\n- Arthurian chivalry (explicitly mentioned)\n- Dungeon pits (explicitly mentioned: \"smell the fear rising from the dungeon pits\")\n- Battles (mentioned: \"sounds and smells of battles long gone\")\n- Hooves/horses (mentioned: \"clatter of hooves on the cobbles\")\n\nNow let me check each option:\n\n1. Dungeon pits - This IS mentioned in the passage (\"smell the fear rising from the dungeon pits\")\n2. Jousts - This IS mentioned in the passage (\"conjuring up images of jousts\")\n3. Chivalry - This IS mentioned in the passage (\"Arthurian chivalry\")\n4. Knights - This is NOT explicitly mentioned in the passage\n\nWhile the passage mentions \"Arthurian chivalry,\" jousts, battles, and other medieval elements that we might associate with knights, the word \"knights\" itself is never actually used in the passage.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to find what is predominantly used in Javanese cuisine.\n\nStep 1: Identify what the passage says about Javanese cuisine flavoring.\nThe passage states: \"Javanese cuisine features an array of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavorings the Javanese favor being peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.\"\n\nStep 2: Focus on the sugar mentioned.\nThe passage specifically mentions \"sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar)\" as one of the predominant flavorings.\n\nStep 3: Compare with the given options.\nThe options are:\n1. White sugar\n2. Powdered sugar\n3. Coconut sugar\n4. Brown sugar\n\nStep 4: Match the passage information with the options.\nThe passage explicitly states \"especially Javanese coconut sugar,\" which directly corresponds to option 3 \"Coconut sugar.\"\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to identify who made the comment about the uncomfortable heat level.\n\nStep 1: I need to look for who is quoted in the passage making a statement about the heat.\n\nStep 2: The passage contains a direct quote: \"It was a hot day in the Santa Clara with temperatures in the 90s. Any length of time trapped on a roller coaster would be uncomfortable, to say the least, and it took at least an hour to get the first person off the ride.\"\n\nStep 3: I need to identify who said this quote. Looking at the text immediately before the quote, it states: \"Fire captain Scott Kouns said,\"\n\nStep 4: This clearly indicates that Fire captain Scott Kouns is the person who made the comment about the uncomfortable heat level and the situation.\n\nStep 5: Looking at the options:\n- Option 1: The ride operator - not mentioned as making any statement\n- Option 2: The fire captain - this matches Scott Kouns who made the quoted statement\n- Option 3: The passengers - they are mentioned as receiving water but not as making statements\n- Option 4: The police chief - not mentioned in the passage\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what the passage says about fusion in stars:\n- The passage states: \"Stars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms are merged (or fused) together to form heavier elements.\"\n\nNow I need to understand what fusion allows stars to do according to this statement:\n- Fusion is the process of hydrogen atoms being merged together\n- This fusion process makes energy\n- Because of this energy from fusion, stars give off light and heat\n- The fusion also forms heavier elements\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Form heavier elements - This happens during fusion, but the passage emphasizes that stars give off light and heat \"because of\" the energy from fusion\n2. Build fusion reactors - This is what scientists are trying to do, not what stars do\n3. Give off light and heat - This is what the passage directly states fusion allows stars to do\n4. Create hydrogen atoms - The passage says hydrogen atoms are fused together, not created\n\nThe passage clearly states that fusion allows stars to give off light and heat because of the energy produced by the fusion process.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what the passage explicitly states Charles was the first to do.\n\nThe passage mentions several things about Charles:\n- He went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge (instead of going straight to military)\n- He studied Anthropology and Archaeology, then later History\n- He earned a 2:2 degree\n- He was \"the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree\"\n\nNow let me check each option against what the passage says:\n\nOption 1: \"Join the military before finishing school\" - The passage says traditionally heirs went to military AFTER finishing school, and Charles didn't follow this tradition at all. This is not what Charles was first to do.\n\nOption 2: \"Study Archaeology\" - While Charles did study Archaeology, the passage doesn't say he was the first royal family member to study this subject.\n\nOption 3: \"Earn a degree\" - The passage explicitly states \"Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.\" This directly matches this option.\n\nOption 4: \"Attend Trinity College\" - While Charles did attend Trinity College, the passage doesn't say he was the first royal family member to attend this college.\n\nThe passage clearly and explicitly states that Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what scaffolding is according to the passage:\n- Scaffolding is an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new learning experience\n- It can be virtual (like software features) or real (like a teacher)\n- The purpose is to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the student to handle alone\n- Examples given: a teacher, the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game - This provides support and guidance for a new learning experience (learning the game), so this IS scaffolding.\n\n2. An SAT tutor - This is a person who provides support and guidance to help students with challenging material they might not handle alone, so this IS scaffolding.\n\n3. An independent study program - This is specifically designed for students to work alone without support or guidance. The key word \"independent\" indicates no scaffolding support is provided, so this is NOT scaffolding.\n\n4. A little league coach - This is a person who provides support, guidance, and instruction to help players learn skills they couldn't master alone, so this IS scaffolding.\n\nThe question asks which is NOT an example of scaffolding. Based on my analysis, the independent study program is the only option that doesn't provide the support characteristic of scaffolding.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a hospitality exchange network is according to the passage:\n- It's an organization that connects travelers with locals in cities they plan to visit\n\nNext, let me identify what the network provides:\n- After joining (by filling out an online form), travelers get \"a listing of available hosts\"\n- These listings are provided in print and/or online\n- The listings sometimes include references and reviews by other travelers\n\nThe passage also gives an example with Couchsurfing:\n- Casey Fenton needed a place to stay in Iceland\n- He contacted local university students\n- He received \"offers for free accommodation\"\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. Accommodations with local hosts - This matches what the passage describes. The network connects travelers with \"locals\" who are listed as \"available hosts\" and offer \"accommodation.\"\n\n2. Cheap flights - The passage mentions Casey found a cheap flight, but this was separate from the hospitality network. The network didn't provide the flight.\n\n3. Tours given by local guides - The passage doesn't mention tours or guides at all.\n\n4. Connections with other travelers visiting the same destination - The passage talks about connecting travelers with locals, not with other travelers.\n\nThe passage clearly states that hospitality exchange networks connect travelers with local hosts who provide accommodation.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to determine which category visiting a museum would fall under.\n\nStep 1: Identify the types of tourism mentioned in the passage.\nThe passage describes two types of tourism:\n- Recreation tourism\n- Cultural tourism\n\nStep 2: Understand what recreation tourism involves.\nAccording to the passage, recreation tourism is \"when people go to a place that is very different from their regular day-to-day life to relax and have fun.\" Examples given are beaches, theme parks, and camp grounds.\n\nStep 3: Understand what cultural tourism involves.\nThe passage states that cultural tourism occurs \"if the objective of one's visit to a particular place is to get to know its history and culture.\" It mentions that tourists may visit different landmarks or focus on one area.\n\nStep 4: Determine what visiting a museum represents.\nMuseums are institutions that preserve and display artifacts, art, historical items, and cultural exhibits. The primary purpose of visiting a museum is typically to learn about history, culture, art, or science.\n\nStep 5: Match museum visits to the appropriate tourism category.\nSince visiting a museum is primarily about learning and experiencing history and culture rather than just relaxing and having fun, it aligns with the definition of cultural tourism provided in the passage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what the passage says about re-entry shock and which travelers might find it especially difficult.\n\nThe passage states:\n- Re-entry shock comes on sooner than culture shock\n- It lasts longer and can be more severe than culture shock\n- There's less of a honeymoon phase with re-entry shock\n\nThen, the key sentence: \"Travellers who had an easy time adjusting to the new culture sometimes have a particularly hard time readjusting to their native culture.\"\n\nThis directly tells us that travelers who adjusted easily (quickly/well) to the foreign culture may have particular difficulty with re-entry shock.\n\nThe passage explains this happens because:\n- You've adapted to the new culture\n- You've lost some habits from your home culture\n- People at home may not be as patient/understanding as they were when you first went abroad\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Travelers who experienced particularly bad culture shock - This contradicts the passage\n2. Travelers who adjusted quickly while living abroad - This matches the key sentence about those who \"had an easy time adjusting\"\n3. Travelers that are still in the honeymoon phase - The passage says there's less honeymoon phase with re-entry shock\n4. Travelers with less patience - This isn't mentioned as a factor\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage states that \"Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire.\"\n\n2. It mentions that \"If you want to learn throwing a boomerang that comes back to your hand, make sure you have a suitable boomerang for returning.\"\n\n3. The key information is: \"Most boomerangs available in Australia are in fact non-returning.\"\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\nOption 1: \"It will always come back to your hand if thrown correctly\" - This contradicts the passage, which states that most boomerangs are non-returning, meaning they won't come back regardless of how they're thrown.\n\nOption 2: \"It's more popular amongst locals than tourists\" - The passage says tourists want to acquire this skill, but doesn't compare popularity between locals and tourists.\n\nOption 3: \"There are not many boomerangs available in Australia\" - The passage doesn't suggest scarcity of boomerangs, just that most available ones are non-returning.\n\nOption 4: \"Only some boomerangs are able to return\" - This aligns with the passage, which indicates you need a \"suitable boomerang for returning\" and that \"most boomerangs available in Australia are in fact non-returning,\" implying only some can return.\n\n4",
      "Let me read through the passage step by step to find information about the match at Ellis Park.\n\n1. The passage describes a match between South Africa (Springboks) and New Zealand (All Blacks) at Royal Bafokeng Stadium.\n\n2. South Africa won 21-20, ending New Zealand's 15-game winning streak.\n\n3. The passage mentions this was the final match for the All Blacks, who had already won the trophy.\n\n4. The key sentence is: \"The final match of the series will take place at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks play Australia.\"\n\nThis clearly states that the match at Ellis Park will be between the Springboks (which is South Africa's rugby team name) and Australia.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Option 1: All Blacks and Australia - No, All Blacks already finished\n- Option 2: New Zealand and South Africa - No, this was the previous match\n- Option 3: South Africa and Australia - Yes, this matches what the passage says\n- Option 4: Springboks and All Blacks - No, All Blacks already finished\n\n3",
      "Let me work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what \"pulling the bow\" refers to in the passage.\n\nThe passage states: \"down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.\"\n\nSo \"pulling the bow\" = down bow.\n\nNow let me identify what is associated with down bow (pulling the bow):\n- The down bow mark \"looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side\"\n- You \"start at the frog\" \n- \"A down-bow is stronger and more assertive\"\n\nAnd what is associated with up bow (NOT pulling the bow):\n- The up bow mark \"looks like a V\"\n- You \"start at the tip and push the bow\"\n- \"An up-bow usually generates a softer sound\"\n\nNow I'll check each option to see which is NOT associated with pulling the bow:\n\n1. A softer sound - This is associated with up bow (pushing), not down bow (pulling)\n2. A mark that looks like a staple - This is associated with down bow (pulling)\n3. A stronger sound - This is associated with down bow (pulling) \n4. Starting at the frog - This is associated with down bow (pulling)\n\nTherefore, \"a softer sound\" is NOT associated with pulling the bow.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to find who suggested that the last CEP resign.\n\nStep 1: Identify what happened to the prior CEP\nThe passage states: \"Last month a presidential commission recommended the prior CEP's resignation\"\n\nStep 2: Look for who made this recommendation\nThe text clearly states that \"a presidential commission recommended the prior CEP's resignation\"\n\nStep 3: Understand the context\n- This recommendation was \"part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections\"\n- The commission was created by Martelly in response to protests\n- But the actual recommendation for resignation came from the commission itself\n\nStep 4: Check each option against the text\n1. Martelly - The passage doesn't say Martelly directly suggested the resignation\n2. Protesters - The passage doesn't say protesters suggested the resignation\n3. The presidential commission - The passage explicitly states the commission \"recommended the prior CEP's resignation\"\n4. The CEP members themselves - There's no indication they suggested their own resignation\n\nThe passage clearly states that \"a presidential commission recommended the prior CEP's resignation.\"\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to understand the timing of different protective measures.\n\nThe passage describes several measures being taken against the disease:\n\n1. Current measures already being undertaken:\n   - Deployment of pig catchers in seriously affected areas\n   - Distributing thousands of mosquito curtains\n   - Spraying pesticides\n\n2. Future measures:\n   - Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine have been \"promised by the government\"\n   - These vaccines \"will help prepare health agencies for next year\"\n   - The passage specifically states that \"Plans for vaccines to be delivered to the historically most affected areas this year were delayed due to lack of funds and low prioritisation\"\n\nThe key information is that pig catchers, mosquito curtains, and pesticides are all current measures that \"the outbreak has prompted the Indian government to undertake.\" These are happening now.\n\nIn contrast, the encephalitis vaccines are described as:\n- Promised for the future\n- Will help prepare for \"next year\"\n- Were delayed for this year\n- Are not currently being implemented\n\nThis clearly indicates that the encephalitis vaccines will be implemented last, after all the other measures.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what the passage says can help athletes \"increase their enjoyment of the sport.\"\n\nThe passage states that three things can help athletes improve performance AND increase enjoyment:\n1. Maintaining a healthy energy balance\n2. Practicing effective hydration habits  \n3. Understanding various aspects of supplementation practices\n\nNow I need to check each option against what the passage suggests:\n\nOption 1: \"Practicing proper nutrition\" - The passage discusses nutritional practices and supplementation, so this aligns with what's suggested.\n\nOption 2: \"Consistently performing at an elite level\" - The passage actually states that \"proper nutritional practices alone cannot generate elite performances.\" It doesn't suggest that elite performance itself leads to enjoyment.\n\nOption 3: \"Hydrating effectively\" - This is directly mentioned as one of the practices that can \"increase their enjoyment of the sport.\"\n\nOption 4: \"Maintaining a healthy energy balance\" - This is explicitly mentioned as something that can help \"increase their enjoyment of the sport.\"\n\nThe question asks which is NOT suggested as a way to find more enjoyment. Option 2 (consistently performing at an elite level) is not mentioned as a way to increase enjoyment, and the passage even suggests that elite performance cannot be achieved through nutrition alone.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what the passage says about the transition from quarter-mile to half-mile running:\n- Speed becomes \"of much less importance\"\n- Endurance becomes \"an absolute necessity\"\n\nNext, I'll look at what the passage says about a first-class half-miler:\n- Must be able to \"beat two minutes\" (this is a qualification, but not described as the most important thing)\n- \"must be possessed of a fair amount of speed\" (acknowledges speed is needed)\n- \"but endurance must be cultivated at all hazards\" (the word \"but\" indicates a contrast, and \"at all hazards\" emphasizes the critical importance)\n\nThe passage also mentions training recommendations:\n- Cross country running during winter\n- Gymnasium work for upper body\n- These are described as \"best preparation\" but not as the most important quality\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Cross country running - this is mentioned as good preparation, but not as the most important quality\n2. Cultivating endurance over speed - this directly matches the passage's emphasis that endurance becomes \"an absolute necessity\" and \"must be cultivated at all hazards\"\n3. Clocking under two minutes - this is mentioned as a characteristic of first-class runners, but not as what's most important\n4. Cultivating speed over endurance - this contradicts the passage, which clearly states speed becomes \"much less important\"\n\nThe passage clearly emphasizes that endurance is the most critical factor, stating it's \"an absolute necessity\" and \"must be cultivated at all hazards.\"\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage discusses how primates on the savanna face a \"protein problem\" - difficulty getting adequate amino acids from available food sources.\n\nKey points from the passage:\n1. Plant proteins in leaves and legumes are available but \"hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked\"\n2. Animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are \"easily digestible\" and \"provide high-quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids\"\n3. The passage suggests our ancestors likely solved their protein problem \"in somewhat the same way that chimps on the savanna do today\" - implying they ate animal foods\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. Dead leaves - The passage mentions leaves contain proteins but are hard to digest unless cooked. Dead leaves would be even less nutritious than fresh leaves.\n\n2. Raw legumes - The passage specifically states legumes are hard for primates to digest unless cooked, so raw legumes would not solve the protein problem.\n\n3. Grasshoppers - This is an animal food (insect), similar to the ants and termites mentioned in the passage as good protein sources that are easily digestible.\n\n4. Flower stems - This would be plant material, and the passage indicates plant materials are problematic for meeting protein needs unless cooked.\n\nBased on the passage's emphasis on animal foods being the solution to the protein problem, grasshoppers (an insect/animal food) would be the best choice.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to find what reflects long distance calls back down to Earth.\n\nStep 1: Identify what the passage says about long distance calls.\nThe passage states: \"When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.\"\n\nStep 2: Find what happens with the satellite during a call.\nThe passage explains: \"The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.\"\n\nStep 3: Check what each option does according to the passage.\n- Telescopes: Used by scientists in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts light and view - no mention of reflecting calls\n- Satellites: Specifically stated to get calls and reflect them back down\n- Lights: Only mentioned as being distorted by Earth's atmosphere - no connection to calls\n- Rockets: Used to send satellites and telescopes into space - no mention of reflecting calls\n\nStep 4: Determine the correct answer.\nThe passage clearly states that satellites receive long distance calls and reflect them back down to Earth.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage states:\n- If you stood on Io's surface, you would weigh less than on Earth\n- A 200-pound person on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds on Io\n- \"So the gravity, of course, pulls less on you\" (referring to Io's gravity)\n\nThis means:\n- Io's gravity is weaker than Earth's gravity\n- Because Io's gravity is weaker, you weigh less on Io\n- Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's gravity\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. \"Earth's gravity would pull less on you than Io's gravity\" - This is incorrect. The passage shows Earth's gravity is stronger.\n\n2. \"Io's gravity pulls more, which is why you would weigh less\" - This is contradictory and incorrect. If gravity pulls more, you would weigh more, not less.\n\n3. \"Io's gravity pulls more, which is why you would weigh more\" - This is incorrect. The passage clearly states you weigh less on Io, not more.\n\n4. \"Earth's gravity would pull more on you than Io's gravity\" - This is correct. The passage demonstrates that Earth's gravity is stronger (200 lbs vs 36 lbs), so Earth's gravity pulls more than Io's gravity.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step to understand what the photographer was attempting to do before being struck.\n\nStep 1: Identify the sequence of events described in the passage.\n- The photographer stopped his vehicle on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard\n- He attempted to take pictures of a police stop\n- He crossed the road and continued (presumably taking photos)\n- A police officer ordered him back across the road twice\n- He was then struck by a vehicle\n\nStep 2: Determine what the photographer's primary intention/attempt was.\nThe passage states: \"TMZ understands the photographer stopped his vehicle on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and attempted to take pictures of the police stop before crossing the road and continuing\"\n\nStep 3: Analyze each option:\n1. Park on Sepulveda Boulevard - The passage mentions he stopped his vehicle, but this wasn't his main purpose\n2. Take photos of a police stop - This is explicitly stated as what he \"attempted\" to do\n3. Cross a busy highway - While he did cross the road, this was in service of his photography, not the main goal\n4. Convince a police officer to let him continue shooting - There's no mention of him trying to convince the officer of anything\n\nStep 4: The passage clearly states the photographer \"attempted to take pictures of the police stop\" - this was his primary objective before the tragic accident occurred.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to identify what the passage says about the extremists' plan.\n\n2. The passage states that extremists from Somalia are planning to launch suicide bomb attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia.\n\n3. The passage specifically mentions that the attacks will target \"prominent landmarks\" in Ethiopia and Kenya.\n\n4. So the plan involves:\n   - Two countries: Kenya and Ethiopia\n   - Specific targets: prominent landmarks\n   - Method: suicide bomb attacks\n\n5. Now I'll evaluate each option:\n   - Option 1: \"Detonate bombs at landmarks in one country\" - This is incorrect because the plan involves two countries (Kenya and Ethiopia)\n   - Option 2: \"Detonate bombs in two countries\" - This is partially correct but doesn't mention the specific targeting of landmarks\n   - Option 3: \"Detonate bombs at landmarks in two countries\" - This accurately captures both elements: landmarks as targets and two countries (Kenya and Ethiopia)\n   - Option 4: \"Detonate bombs in one country\" - This is incorrect because the plan involves two countries\n\nThe most accurate and complete description is option 3, which includes both the targeting of landmarks and the fact that attacks are planned in two countries.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step:\n\n1. The passage states that Kirby Muxloe Castle is \"typical for the period\" - this means it was representative of castles built during that time.\n\n2. It's described as \"more of a fortified house than a true castle\" with \"large glazed windows and thin walls.\"\n\n3. The passage explicitly states these features \"would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long.\"\n\n4. The construction began in the 1480s by Lord Hastings during a time when \"the country was relatively peaceful.\"\n\n5. Defense was \"only required against small bands of roving marauders\" - not major military threats.\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\nOption 1: The passage mentions \"thin walls,\" not thick walls, so this is incorrect.\n\nOption 2: This aligns with the passage - because the country was peaceful and only small threats existed, minimal fortification was needed. The thin walls and large windows support this.\n\nOption 3: The passage says it was \"typical for the period,\" so this contradicts the text.\n\nOption 4: The passage explicitly states it \"would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long,\" so this is incorrect.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to identify which organization is under legal investigation.\n\nStep 1: Identify the key information about investigations mentioned in the passage.\nThe passage mentions that the Komen Foundation adopted a new rule that disqualifies organizations \"that are under legal investigation.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine which organization was disqualified and why.\nThe passage states: \"Komen's policy disqualified Planned Parenthood due to a pending investigation on how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money.\"\n\nStep 3: Identify who is conducting the investigation.\nThe investigation is being conducted by Representative Cliff Stearns, who is investigating \"whether taxes are used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nStep 4: Confirm which organization is the subject of the investigation.\nThe passage clearly states that Planned Parenthood is under investigation regarding how it \"spends and reports its money\" and whether \"taxes are used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nStep 5: Check the other organizations mentioned.\n- The House Energy and Commerce Committee: This is mentioned as an umbrella organization, not as being under investigation\n- The Komen Foundation: This is the organization that created the policy, not the one being investigated\n- The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee: This is part of the investigating body, not the subject of investigation\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that Planned Parenthood is the organization under legal investigation.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to understand what it says about which part of a cycad plant a Triceratops might eat.\n\nFirst, let me identify what the passage tells us about cycads:\n- Cycads are plants that were common in the Cretaceous period\n- They look like small palm trees with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves\n- Some scientists think these plants are very poisonous\n\nNow, let me look at what the passage says about how a Triceratops might interact with cycads:\n- Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads\n- The passage states: \"A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before eating the trunk\"\n\nThis sentence is key - it indicates that the Triceratops would strip off the leaves (implying it wouldn't eat them) and then eat the trunk.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. The spiky leaves - The passage suggests these would be stripped off, not eaten\n2. The trunk - The passage specifically states the Triceratops would eat the trunk after stripping off the leaves\n3. The root - Not mentioned as something the Triceratops would eat\n4. The fruit - Not mentioned in the passage at all\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that a Triceratops would eat the trunk of the cycad plant after removing the leaves.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze each option against what the passage says:\n\nStep 1: Check option 1 - \"The fights in North Kivu are entertaining\"\nThe passage states that \"any visits outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the North Kivu province.\" This clearly indicates the fighting is a safety concern, not entertainment. This would be bad advice for tourists.\n\nStep 2: Check option 2 - \"It's a good place for affordable Mountain Gorilla Tracking\"\nThe passage explicitly states \"some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.\" This would be good advice for tourists.\n\nStep 3: Check option 3 - \"Motorcycle taxis are a good way to get around\"\nThe passage says \"You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma\" and even provides pricing information. This would be good advice for tourists.\n\nStep 4: Check option 4 - \"The base of the Nyiragongo volcano is located in the city\"\nThe passage states \"The city is also the base to climb the Nyiragongo volcano.\" This would be good advice for tourists interested in volcano climbing.\n\nThe question asks which would NOT be a good tip for tourists. Option 1 presents the dangerous fighting as entertainment, which contradicts the passage's warning about safety concerns.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage discusses two main approaches to cheap travel:\n1. Work while you travel\n2. Limit your expenses\n\nThe passage focuses on the second approach - limiting expenses for minimum budget travel.\n\nFor minimum budget travel, the passage states that travelers must be \"willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to push expenses down close to zero.\"\n\nThis means that to travel on a very minimal budget, you need to be willing to give up:\n- Comfort\n- Time (meaning you can't be on a strict schedule)\n- Predictability (meaning you can't follow a fixed plan)\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. Someone who welcomes a challenge - This person would likely do well with minimal budget travel since they're open to challenges.\n\n2. Someone without strict time constraints - This person would do well since minimal budget travel requires sacrificing time/schedule flexibility.\n\n3. Someone planning to work remotely while traveling - This relates to the first category (work while traveling), not the minimal budget approach being discussed.\n\n4. Someone who enjoys following an itinerary - This person would have difficulty because minimal budget travel requires sacrificing \"predictability,\" which means you can't stick to a fixed itinerary or plan.\n\nThe answer is the person who would struggle with giving up predictability and following set plans.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to identify what differs between French in France versus Belgium and Switzerland.\n\nStep 1: Identify what the passage says is different\n- The passage states that \"the numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some slight peculiarities that are different from the French spoken in France\"\n- It also mentions \"the pronunciation of some words is slightly different\"\n\nStep 2: Identify what the passage says is the same or similar\n- The varieties are \"similar enough to be mutually intelligible\"\n- \"All French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned standard French in school\" - this implies the standard French taught is the same\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option\n1. \"The pronunciation of all words\" - The passage says \"pronunciation of some words is slightly different,\" not ALL words\n2. \"The numbering system\" - The passage explicitly states this has \"peculiarities that are different\"\n3. \"The standard French taught in schools\" - The passage implies this is the same (standard French)\n4. \"The spelling of some French words\" - The passage does not mention spelling differences at all\n\nStep 4: Determine which option is clearly stated as different\nThe passage explicitly mentions that the numbering system is different between France and Belgium/Switzerland.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step to determine when the phase change occurred.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what caused the phase change according to the passage:\n- The passage states \"The significant earthquake activity resulting in the phase change had took place on March 10\"\n\nThis clearly indicates that:\n1. There was significant earthquake activity on March 10\n2. This earthquake activity resulted in the phase change\n3. Therefore, the phase change occurred on March 10\n\nLet me verify this against the other timeframes mentioned:\n- \"Week prior\" - no earthquakes reported by US Geological Survey\n- \"Past 48 hours\" - no earthquake activity reported by Icelandic Meteorological Office in Hekla area\n- \"March 10\" - significant earthquake activity that resulted in the phase change\n\nThe passage directly states that the earthquake activity that resulted in the phase change took place on March 10.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to understand what should be noted about a cyclical event to track the passing of time.\n\nFirst, let me identify what the passage says about cyclical events:\n- The passage states: \"You can mark the passing of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event.\"\n- It then defines a cyclical event as: \"A cyclical event is something that happens again and again regularly.\"\n\nNow let me examine each option in relation to what the passage says about using cyclical events to track time:\n\n1. Duration - While the passage mentions that \"Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events,\" this is not specifically what should be noted about cyclical events for tracking time.\n\n2. Repetition - The passage explicitly states that you can mark the passing of time by \"observing the repetition of a cyclical event.\" This directly connects repetition to tracking time.\n\n3. Affect - The passage mentions that time \"affects everything we do,\" but this is not related to what should be noted about cyclical events for tracking time.\n\n4. Difficulty - The passage mentions time is \"difficult to understand,\" but this is not what should be noted about cyclical events for tracking time.\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that repetition is the key characteristic of cyclical events that allows us to track the passing of time.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to identify what issues ARE mentioned in the document, then determine which option is NOT included.\n\nStep 1: Identify what issues the passage says are covered in the document:\n- The borders dispute (Palestine wants borders based on pre-1967 Mideast War borders)\n- The future state of Jerusalem (described as sacred to both nations)\n- The Jordan Valley issue (specifically about military presence - Israel wants 10 years, PA agrees to only 5 years)\n\nStep 2: Check each option against what's mentioned:\n\nOption 1: \"The future of Jerusalem\" - YES, this is mentioned as being covered in the document\n\nOption 2: \"The cause of the 1967 war\" - NO, the passage only mentions \"the borders before the 1967 Mideast War\" as a reference point for the border dispute, but does not mention discussing the causes of that war\n\nOption 3: \"Military presence in the valley\" - YES, this is mentioned (the Jordan Valley issue with disagreement over duration)\n\nOption 4: \"The dispute over borders\" - YES, this is mentioned as the borders dispute\n\nStep 3: Determine which is NOT included:\nThe passage does not mention anything about discussing the causes or reasons for the 1967 war - it only uses the pre-1967 borders as a reference point for current border negotiations.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to identify what it says about the protests.\n\nFrom the passage, I can extract the following information about the protests:\n\n1. There were \"widespread anti-regime protests that started in October\"\n2. \"The commission was Martelly's response to\" these protests\n3. \"The sometimes-violent protests were triggered by failure to hold elections, some due since 2011\"\n4. The presidential commission \"recommended the prior CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections\"\n\nNow let me check each option against what the passage actually states:\n\nOption 1: \"The presidential commission was a response to the protests\"\n- The passage states: \"The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests\"\n- This is TRUE according to the passage.\n\nOption 2: \"Overdue elections triggered the protests\" \n- The passage states: \"protests were triggered by failure to hold elections, some due since 2011\"\n- This is TRUE according to the passage.\n\nOption 3: \"Protests demanded the resignation of the prior CEP\"\n- The passage states that the presidential commission (Martelly's response to protests) recommended the CEP's resignation, but it does NOT say the protests themselves directly demanded the CEP's resignation.\n- This is NOT directly stated in the passage.\n\nOption 4: \"The protests were sometimes violent\"\n- The passage explicitly states: \"The sometimes-violent protests\"\n- This is TRUE according to the passage.\n\nOption 3 is not directly supported by the passage. The passage only says that Martelly's commission recommended the CEP's resignation in response to the protests, not that the protests themselves specifically demanded this resignation.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to understand when the police were able to clock Jonny Reid's speed.\n\nStep 1: Identify what the passage says about the police's ability to use radar guns.\nThe passage states: \"The New Zealand police had trouble using their speed radar guns to see how fast Mr Reid was going because of how low Black Beauty is\"\n\nStep 2: Determine when they were successful in clocking his speed.\nThe passage continues: \"and the only time the police managed to clock Mr Reid was when he slowed down to 160km/h\"\n\nStep 3: Analyze what this means.\n- The police had trouble with their radar guns most of the time\n- They could only successfully measure his speed when he slowed down to 160km/h\n- This means they were able to clock him specifically when he was driving at 160km/h (not over 160km/h)\n\nStep 4: Match this with the options.\nOption 1: \"While he was driving at 160km/h\" - This matches exactly with \"when he slowed down to 160km/h\"\nOption 2: \"On his seventh time over the bridge\" - The passage doesn't specify which crossing this occurred on\nOption 3: \"While he was driving over 160km/h\" - This contradicts the passage, as they had trouble clocking him at higher speeds\nOption 4: \"On his first time over the bridge\" - The passage doesn't specify which crossing this occurred on\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what the passage says about different ingredients used in curries in different regions.\n\nThe passage states:\n- Curries are based on herbs and spices, with either meat or vegetables\n- In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries\n- In Southern India and some coastal regions, coconut milk is commonly used\n\nThe key insight is that the passage is contrasting two different regional practices:\n- Northern India/Pakistan: yogurt is commonly used\n- Southern India/coastal regions: coconut milk is commonly used\n\nThis suggests that coconut milk and yogurt serve similar functions in curry preparation, but are used in different regions. The passage implies that coconut milk is used as an alternative to yogurt depending on the geographic region.\n\nThe question asks what coconut milk is used \"in place of\" - this indicates a substitution relationship. Based on the regional contrast described in the passage, coconut milk appears to be used in place of yogurt.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage is giving travel advice for women in a region bounded by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.\n\nLet me examine each option against what the passage actually says:\n\nOption 1: \"Recognize that it is uncommon to be followed\"\nThe passage states \"it is not uncommon to be followed\" - this means it IS common to be followed. So this option contradicts the passage.\n\nOption 2: \"Wear a large ring to signify martial status\"\nThe passage says \"wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive)\" - so it should NOT be large/expensive looking. This contradicts the advice given.\n\nOption 3: \"Understand that cultural differences suggest that you avoid standing your ground\"\nThe passage explicitly states \"don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it doesn't make it ok!)\" - this directly contradicts the passage's advice.\n\nOption 4: \"In the case of unwanted advances, be firm with turning down men\"\nThe passage states \"Be firm in turning down men\" - this directly matches the advice given in the passage.\n\nOption 4 is the only one that accurately reflects the travel advice provided in the passage.\n\n4",
      "Let me trace the timeline of where the Dunlap broadsides went according to the passage:\n\n1. First, the handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop on July 4, where 150-200 copies (Dunlap broadsides) were made through the night.\n\n2. On July 6, one copy was sent to George Washington (who was in New York).\n\n3. On July 8, the first public reading occurred at Independence Hall (in the yard).\n\n4. On July 9, Washington had it read to his troops in New York.\n\n5. On August 10, a copy reached London.\n\nNow I need to determine which location received a Dunlap broadside last:\n\n- Dunlap's printing shop: This is where they were created on July 4 (first)\n- New York: A copy was sent there on July 6, read on July 9\n- Independence Hall: Public reading occurred on July 8\n- London: A copy arrived on August 10\n\nLooking at the dates, London received a copy on August 10, which is the latest date mentioned for any location receiving a Dunlap broadside.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to identify what are stated as main staples of Majorcan cuisine.\n\nStep 1: Identify what the passage explicitly states as the basis of Majorcan cuisine.\nThe passage says: \"Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar zones in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (specially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.\"\n\nStep 2: List the main staples mentioned.\nFrom the passage, the main staples are:\n- Bread\n- Vegetables \n- Meat (especially pork)\n- Olive oil (used throughout)\n\nStep 3: Compare each option with what's mentioned in the passage.\nOption 1: Meat - This IS mentioned as a main staple\nOption 2: Bread - This IS mentioned as a main staple\nOption 3: Grain - This is NOT mentioned anywhere in the passage\nOption 4: Vegetables - This IS mentioned as a main staple\n\nStep 4: Determine which option is NOT a main staple according to the passage.\nWhile grain might be related to bread production, the passage does not explicitly mention \"grain\" as a main staple of Majorcan cuisine. The passage only mentions bread, vegetables, meat, and olive oil.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to identify what triggers avalanches versus what doesn't.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage says about avalanche triggers:\n- The passage states that \"snow is sticky, so it needs some triggering to come down\"\n- It then lists several triggering events: \"Sometimes the original triggering event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes some more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human\"\n\nNow let me examine each option:\n\nOption 1: Sticky snow\n- The passage says \"snow is sticky, so it needs some triggering to come down\"\n- This indicates that sticky snow is NOT a trigger, but rather a characteristic that REQUIRES triggering\n- Sticky snow is the reason why triggering is needed, not the trigger itself\n\nOption 2: Humans\n- The passage explicitly states \"often a human\" as a triggering event\n- This IS a trigger\n\nOption 3: Sunshine\n- The passage states \"Sometimes the original triggering event is the sun warming the snow\"\n- This IS a trigger\n\nOption 4: Additional snowfall\n- The passage states \"sometimes some more snowfall\" as a triggering event\n- This IS a trigger\n\nBased on this analysis, sticky snow is not a trigger for avalanches - it's actually the property that makes triggering necessary in the first place.\n\n1",
      "Let me read through the passage carefully to find information about Homer.\n\nThe passage states: \"Possibly the most known person of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.\"\n\nThe key word here is \"blind.\" When someone is described as blind, it means they cannot see.\n\nThe question asks what Homer was unable to do, and the passage specifically describes him as \"the legendary blind poet.\"\n\nBeing blind means having the inability to see.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Hear - The passage doesn't mention any hearing problems\n2. See - This matches with being described as \"blind\"\n3. Walk - The passage doesn't mention any mobility issues\n4. Talk - The passage doesn't mention any speech problems\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this step by step.\n\nThe passage discusses what needs to be added when comparing a total fare quote to Africa with a round-the-world fare.\n\nThe passage specifically states: \"Don't forget to add in the extra costs of additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.\"\n\nKey phrase here is \"outside of Africa\" - the passage is telling us to add costs for places that are NOT in Africa.\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. Cost of additional visas for places outside of Africa - The passage says to ADD this\n2. Cost of the departure taxes in Africa - The passage mentions \"departure taxes\" but specifically says to add costs for places \"outside of Africa,\" not inside Africa\n3. Cost of an African visa - This would be for Africa itself, not outside of Africa, so this wouldn't need to be added according to the passage's instruction about adding costs for places \"outside of Africa\"\n4. Cost of ground transportation for locations outside of Africa - The passage says to ADD this\n\nThe passage is telling us to add extra costs for places outside of Africa. Therefore, costs that are for Africa itself (not outside of Africa) would not need to be added according to this instruction.\n\nOption 3 (Cost of an African visa) is a cost for Africa itself, not for places outside of Africa.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze what Hu mentioned in the passage step by step:\n\n1. **The basis for the cuts**: Hu said \"they will be made based on China's economic output\" - this WAS mentioned.\n\n2. **Advice to developing countries regarding pollution**: Hu encouraged developing countries \"to avoid the old path of polluting first and cleaning up later\" - this WAS mentioned.\n\n3. **A date when carbon emissions will hopefully be cut by**: Hu said \"by 2020 from the 2005 level\" - this WAS mentioned.\n\n4. **A figure for the carbon emission cuts**: The passage explicitly states \"He did not set a figure for the cuts\" - this was NOT mentioned.\n\nThe question asks what was NOT mentioned by Hu. Based on my analysis, Hu did not provide a specific figure or percentage for the carbon emission cuts.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to understand where an average Babylonian citizen would and would not be found.\n\nFrom the passage, I can identify these key points:\n\n1. Babylonians built primary temples for their gods\n2. People would bring sacrifices to the gods\n3. Priests would attend to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals\n4. Each temple had an open temple courtyard\n5. Each temple had an inner sanctuary that \"only the priests could enter\"\n6. Ziggurats were sometimes built as part of temples with special sanctuaries at the top\n\nNow let me examine each option:\n\nOption 1: \"Bringing sacrifices to a temple courtyard\" - The passage states people brought sacrifices to the gods, and mentions open temple courtyards, so this would be allowed for citizens.\n\nOption 2: \"Attending a ceremony at a primary temple\" - The passage mentions priests conducted ceremonies, and since these were for the gods that people worshipped, citizens would likely attend these.\n\nOption 3: \"At a festival in a temple courtyard\" - Similar to ceremonies, festivals were conducted by priests for the gods, and the courtyard was open, so citizens could attend.\n\nOption 4: \"Bringing sacrifices to an inner sanctuary\" - The passage explicitly states that the inner sanctuary was a place \"that only the priests could enter.\" This means average citizens would not be found there, even to bring sacrifices.\n\nThe key restriction mentioned in the passage is that only priests could enter the inner sanctuary.\n\n4",
      "Let me read through the passage carefully and identify what causes a light bulb to stop working.\n\nThe passage states: \"After hundreds of hours of operation the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works.\"\n\nThis directly tells us that the filament burning out is what causes the light bulb to stop working.\n\nLet me check the other options mentioned in the passage:\n\n- Option 1 (light fixture not being turned off correctly) - This is mentioned as a safety precaution when replacing bulbs, not as a cause of bulb failure.\n\n- Option 2 (bulb's metal base only partially in socket) - This is mentioned as a safety hazard during replacement, not as a cause of the original bulb failure.\n\n- Option 4 (electricity flow slowing down) - This is not mentioned anywhere in the passage as a cause of bulb failure.\n\nThe passage clearly and directly states that the filament burning out is what eventually causes the light bulb to stop working after hundreds of hours of operation.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to understand what clothing items are available to borrow from monasteries.\n\nStep 1: Identify what the passage says about borrowing clothing items.\n\nThe passage mentions:\n- \"Most of the monasteries do provide wraps for women who come unprepared\"\n- \"men are required to wear trousers covering the knees. This too can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance\"\n- \"you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts\" (referring to borrowed clothing for men)\n\nStep 2: List what can be borrowed according to the passage.\n\nFrom the text, I can identify these borrowable items:\n- Wraps (for women)\n- Trousers (for men)\n- Skirts (the passage mentions men might not feel comfortable wearing \"these skirts\" from the borrowed stock)\n\nStep 3: Consider what is NOT mentioned as borrowable.\n\nThe passage does not mention shorts being available to borrow. In fact, the dress code requires covering the knees, which suggests shorts would not be appropriate or provided.\n\nStep 4: Check each option.\n\n1. Skirts - mentioned as borrowable (\"these skirts\")\n2. Shorts - not mentioned as borrowable\n3. Trousers - explicitly mentioned as borrowable\n4. Wraps - explicitly mentioned as borrowable\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to understand when South Africa's game began to improve.\n\nStep 1: Identify what the passage says about South Africa's performance timeline.\n\nThe passage mentions:\n- South Africa had a comfortable 26-0 win against Zambia\n- They looked \"decidedly rusty in the game against their southern sisters\" (referring to Zambia)\n- Then it states: \"South Africa however steadily improved as the tournament progressed\"\n\nStep 2: Examine each option against the passage.\n\nOption 1: \"Around 10:00 am\" - The passage mentions games kicked off at 10:00 am, but this doesn't indicate when improvement began.\n\nOption 2: \"After tightening the defense\" - The passage mentions their disciplined defense as a strength, but doesn't say improvement came after tightening defense.\n\nOption 3: \"After losing to Zambia\" - This is incorrect. South Africa won against Zambia 26-0, they didn't lose.\n\nOption 4: \"As the tournament went on\" - This directly matches the passage which states \"South Africa however steadily improved as the tournament progressed.\"\n\nStep 3: Confirm the answer.\n\nThe passage explicitly states that South Africa \"steadily improved as the tournament progressed,\" which directly corresponds to option 4.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to identify which process adds genetic variation.\n\nThe passage states: \"Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.\"\n\nThis sentence directly tells us that mutation is the process responsible for adding new genetic variation.\n\nLet me check what the other processes do according to the passage:\n- Segregation and recombination: The passage says these \"shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation\" - so they move existing variation around, but don't add new variation\n- Selection: The passage says this \"removes\" variation from the expressed pool\n- \"Expressed\" is not a process but rather describes one of the two pools of genetic variation\n\nThe passage clearly and explicitly states that mutation is what adds new genetic variation.\n\n3",

Being born in Zagreb doesn't mean he played for a team there. ✗\n\nStep 3: Check statement 3 - \"He played for Partizan until 1995\"\nThe passage clearly states he \"stayed until 1958,\" not 1995. The year 1995 is when he was voted best player in Partizan's history, not when he stopped playing. ✗\n\nStep 4: Check statement 4 - \"He gained fame after being voted Partizan's best player\"\nThe passage says he \"gained fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade\" (1945-1958) and \"In 1995 he was voted the best player in Partizan's history.\" This means he gained fame during his playing years (1945-1958), which was before being voted best player in 1995. ✗\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me identify what the passage directly states:\n- Children develop awareness of race and racial stereotypes at a young age\n- These racial stereotypes affect behavior\n- The passage gives a specific example: children from racial minorities that are stereotyped as not doing well in school tend to perform poorly once they learn about this stereotype\n\nNow let me examine each option:\n\nOption 1: \"The racial minority they choose to identify with\"\n- The passage doesn't suggest children choose their racial identity\n- It talks about children who already \"identify with a racial minority\"\n- This is not supported by the passage\n\nOption 2: \"Their behavior\" \n- The passage explicitly states \"these racial stereotypes affect behavior\"\n- The example given shows how learning about stereotypes affects academic performance (a behavior)\n- This is directly supported by the passage\n\nOption 3: \"Their relationships with other children\"\n- While this might be a logical consequence, the passage doesn't mention relationships with other children\n- This is not directly stated or supported by the passage\n\nOption 4: \"Their definition of race\"\n- The passage doesn't discuss how children define race\n- It talks about awareness of race and stereotypes, but not definitions\n- This is not supported by the passage\n\nThe passage clearly and directly states that racial stereotypes \"affect behavior\" and provides an example of this behavioral impact.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze the passage step by step to understand what eBay is seeking to achieve with this acquisition.\n\nStep 1: Identify what the passage tells us about eBay's goals.\nThe passage states that eBay \"hopes to diversify its profit sources and gain popularity in areas where Skype holds a strong position.\"\n\nStep 2: Break down the two main objectives mentioned.\n- \"diversify its profit sources\" - this means eBay wants to create new revenue streams, not just consolidate existing ones\n- \"gain popularity in areas where Skype holds a strong position, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil\" - this indicates eBay wants to expand its presence in new geographic markets\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option against what the passage says.\n\nOption 1: \"Consolidate its revenue\" - This doesn't match. The passage says \"diversify,\" which means spreading out revenue sources, not consolidating them.\n\nOption 2: \"Expand into new territories\" - This matches well with gaining popularity \"in areas where Skype holds a strong position, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\"\n\nOption 3: \"Raise its profile\" - While \"gain popularity\" could relate to raising profile, this is more about geographic expansion than general profile-raising.\n\nOption 4: \"Satisfy its shareholders\" - This is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nStep 4: Determine the best answer.\nThe passage most clearly indicates that eBay wants to expand into new geographic territories where Skype is already strong.\n\n2"

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage states that Beijing, China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics. It then specifies what will happen where:\n\n- Beijing will host: opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor ice skating events\n- Other skiing activities will be held at Taizicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 kilometers (140 miles) from Beijing\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, which of the following will NOT be held in Beijing during the 2022 Olympics?\"\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n1. Opening ceremony - The passage clearly states this will be held in Beijing\n2. Taizicheng Ski Resort competitions - The passage states these skiing activities will be held in Zhangjiakou, which is 220km away from Beijing, so NOT in Beijing\n3. Closing ceremony - The passage clearly states this will be held in Beijing  \n4. Indoor ice skating events - The passage clearly states these will be held in Beijing\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption 2 (Taizicheng Ski Resort competitions) is the only event that will NOT be held in Beijing according to the passage.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses virtual teams and how they compare to traditional teams. Key points include:\n- Virtual teams must maintain the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with subtle differences\n- Virtual team members often serve as contact points for corresponding offline teams\n- They have more autonomy than traditional team members because they may schedule meetings across different time zones, which local management may not understand\n- There's a concept of \"invisible teams\" - management teams that all members report to and that set standards for everyone\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, what similarities exist between traditional teams and virtual teams?\"\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating each option**\n\nOption 1: \"Both types of teams are expected to have the same level of work performance\"\n- The passage explicitly states \"虚拟团队需要坚持与传统团队同样的质量标准\" (Virtual teams need to maintain the same quality standards as traditional teams)\n- This directly indicates they have the same performance expectations\n\nOption 2: \"Both types of teams have different degrees of autonomy in daily work\"\n- The passage states virtual teams have MORE autonomy than traditional teams, not that both have different degrees\n- This describes a difference, not a similarity\n\nOption 3: \"Both types of teams report to invisible management teams\"\n- The passage only mentions the \"invisible team\" concept in relation to virtual teams\n- No indication that traditional teams have this same structure\n\nOption 4: \"Both types of teams operate in the same time zone\"\n- The passage specifically mentions virtual teams work across different time zones\n- This describes a difference, not a similarity\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nOnly Option 1 describes an actual similarity mentioned in the passage - that both types of teams are held to the same quality standards/performance expectations.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about a traditional medieval castle and how it inspires people's imagination. Let me identify what medieval castle-related things are mentioned:\n\n1. First, I'll go through the passage and identify all the medieval castle-related elements mentioned:\n   - 马背长矛比武 (jousting on horseback) - explicitly mentioned\n   - 宴会 (banquets) - mentioned\n   - 亚瑟王骑士精神 (Arthurian chivalry/knight spirit) - explicitly mentioned\n   - 战争 (wars) - mentioned\n   - 马蹄 (horse hooves) - mentioned\n   - 地牢坑 (dungeon pits) - explicitly mentioned\n\n2. Now let me check each option against what's mentioned in the passage:\n\n   Option 1: 地牢坑 (dungeon pits) - This is mentioned in the text: \"也能闻到从地牢坑里冒出来的恐惧气息\" (can smell the breath of fear rising from the dungeon pits)\n\n   Option 2: 马背长矛比武 (jousting on horseback) - This is mentioned in the text: \"让人联想到马背长矛比武\" (reminds people of jousting on horseback)\n\n   Option 3: 骑士精神 (chivalry/knight spirit) - This is mentioned in the text: \"亚瑟王骑士精神\" (Arthurian chivalry)\n\n   Option 4: 骑士 (knights) - While \"骑士精神\" (chivalry/knight spirit) is mentioned, the word \"骑士\" (knights) by itself is not directly mentioned in the passage.\n\n3. The question asks which item is NOT mentioned in relation to medieval castles.\n\nLooking at the options, \"骑士\" (knights) as a standalone term is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, even though \"骑士精神\" (chivalry/knight spirit) is mentioned.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content**: The passage discusses Indonesian cuisine, explaining that Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so \"Indonesian cuisine\" is a general term covering various regional cuisines across the country.\n\n2. **Key information about Javanese cuisine**: The passage specifically mentions that without additional qualifiers, \"Indonesian cuisine\" often refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of Java island (the main island).\n\n3. **Identifying the main seasonings**: The passage states that Javanese people prefer main seasonings including:\n   - Peanuts (花生)\n   - Chili peppers (辣椒) \n   - Sugar, especially Javanese coconut sugar (糖，尤其是爪哇椰子糖)\n   - Various spices (各种香辛料)\n\n4. **Analyzing the question**: The question asks \"Which of the following is mainly used in Javanese cuisine?\"\n\n5. **Examining the options**:\n   - Option 1: 白糖 (white sugar)\n   - Option 2: 糖粉 (powdered sugar)\n   - Option 3: 椰子糖 (coconut sugar)\n   - Option 4: 红糖 (brown sugar)\n\n6. **Finding the answer**: The passage explicitly mentions \"糖（尤其是爪哇椰子糖）\" which translates to \"sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar).\" This directly corresponds to option 3: 椰子糖 (coconut sugar).\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to identify who made comments about the uncomfortable high temperature in the passage.\n\n2. The passage mentions that passengers were waiting in 90°F heat and received distributed water.\n\n3. Then it quotes Fire Chief Scott Koons (消防队长斯科特·库恩斯) saying: \"Santa Clara was very hot that day, with temperatures reaching over 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\"\n\n4. The quote continues with the Fire Chief describing how uncomfortable it was for people trapped on the roller coaster and how it took at least an hour to rescue the first person.\n\n5. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: Roller coaster operator (过山车操作员) - not mentioned as making comments\n   - Option 2: Fire Chief (消防队长) - this person is directly quoted commenting on the heat\n   - Option 3: Passengers (乘客) - mentioned as experiencing the heat but not quoted commenting on it\n   - Option 4: Police Chief (警察局长) - not mentioned in the passage\n\n6. The question asks who commented on the uncomfortable high temperature. The Fire Chief Scott Koons is the one who is directly quoted making statements about the hot weather and uncomfortable conditions.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage explains that:\n- Stars emit light and heat\n- This happens because hydrogen atoms combine (or fuse) together to form heavier elements, which produces energy\n- Scientists are currently working to create reactors that can produce energy in the same way\n- This is a difficult problem that will take many years to solve before we see practical fusion reactors\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, what does fusion enable stars to do?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"Form heavier elements\" - While the passage mentions that hydrogen atoms fuse to form heavier elements, this is the process itself, not what fusion enables stars to do as a result.\n\n2. \"Build fusion reactors\" - This is what scientists are trying to do, not what stars do.\n\n3. \"Emit light and heat\" - The passage clearly states that stars emit light and heat because of the energy produced when hydrogen atoms fuse together. This is the direct result/capability that fusion gives to stars.\n\n4. \"Produce hydrogen atoms\" - The passage says hydrogen atoms combine/fuse, not that they are produced by fusion.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the correct answer**\nThe passage establishes a clear causal relationship: fusion of hydrogen atoms produces energy, and this energy allows stars to emit light and heat. Therefore, fusion enables stars to emit light and heat.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage tells us about Charles:\n   - Traditionally, heirs to the throne would join the military directly after completing their studies\n   - However, Charles enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge University\n   - He studied anthropology and archaeology there\n   - Later he also studied history\n   - He obtained a 2:2 degree (second-class second division)\n   - Charles was the first British royal family member to obtain a degree\n\n2. Now I'll examine the question: \"According to the information provided in the text, Charles was the first British royal family member to do what?\"\n\n3. Let me evaluate each option:\n   - Option 1: \"Join the military before completing studies\" - This contradicts the passage, which says traditionally heirs joined the military AFTER completing studies, and Charles actually went to university instead\n   - Option 2: \"Study archaeology\" - The passage mentions he studied archaeology, but doesn't say he was the first royal to do so\n   - Option 3: \"Obtain a degree\" - The passage explicitly states \"查尔斯是第一个获得学位的英国王室成员\" (Charles was the first British royal family member to obtain a degree)\n   - Option 4: \"Enroll at Trinity College\" - The passage mentions he enrolled there, but doesn't say he was the first royal to do so\n\n4. The passage clearly and directly states that Charles was the first British royal family member to obtain a degree.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage explains that scaffolded teaching/learning is a method that goes beyond project-based learning to make learning easier and more interesting. Key points:\n\n1. Scaffolded teaching is not a learning method itself, but rather a means of assisting people who are just learning to use new computer programs or starting new projects\n2. It can be conducted online or offline\n3. Teachers are one form of scaffolded teaching, similar to the paper clip assistant in Microsoft Office\n4. Virtual support is built into software to question, prompt, and explain procedures that might be difficult for students to handle independently\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n\n1. **A computer game tutorial at the beginning** - This fits the definition perfectly. It's built-in assistance that helps users learn new software/programs, providing guidance and explanations.\n\n2. **SAT tutor** - This is a form of scaffolded teaching. A tutor provides support, guidance, and assistance to help students learn and master difficult material.\n\n3. **An independent study plan** - This does NOT fit the definition. The key characteristic of scaffolded teaching is providing assistance and support. An \"independent\" study plan specifically lacks the supportive guidance that defines scaffolded teaching.\n\n4. **A little league coach** - This fits the definition. A coach provides guidance, support, and assistance to help players learn and improve their skills.\n\nThe question asks which is NOT an example of scaffolded teaching. Option 3 (independent study plan) contradicts the core concept of scaffolded teaching because it emphasizes independence rather than supportive assistance.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The passage describes a hospitality exchange network that connects travelers with local residents in destination cities\n   - To join, people typically fill out an online form, with some organizations offering additional verification\n   - Members receive a list (paper and/or online) of hosts who have available rooms, sometimes with recommendations and reviews from other travelers\n   - The passage then gives an example about Couchsurfing, founded in January 2004, when programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but had no accommodation, so he emailed local university students and received many offers for free lodging\n\n2. **Analyzing the question:**\n   The question asks: \"What is provided to travelers through the hospitality exchange network?\"\n\n3. **Evaluating each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"Accommodation with local hosts\" - This directly matches what the passage describes - connecting travelers with local residents who provide lodging\n   - Option 2: \"Cheap flights\" - The passage mentions Casey found a cheap flight, but this was separate from the network service; the network doesn't provide flights\n   - Option 3: \"Tourist activities provided by local guides\" - The passage doesn't mention tour guides or tourist activities\n   - Option 4: \"Connection with other travelers going to the same destination\" - The passage talks about connecting travelers with LOCAL RESIDENTS, not with other travelers\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The passage clearly states that the network connects travelers with local residents who provide accommodation, and gives the example of Casey receiving offers for free lodging from local students.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The passage describes two main types of tourism\n   - **Leisure tourism (休闲旅游)**: The most common type where people go to places very different from their daily life for relaxation and entertainment. Examples include beaches, theme parks, and camping sites.\n   - **Cultural tourism (文化旅游)**: When a person visits a specific place with the purpose of learning about its history and culture. Tourists might visit different landmarks in a country or focus on one particular region.\n\n2. **Analyzing the question:**\n   - The question asks: \"Visiting museums belongs to which tourism category?\"\n\n3. **Evaluating the options:**\n   - Option 1: Business tourism (商务旅游) - Not mentioned in the passage\n   - Option 2: Leisure tourism (休闲旅游) - For relaxation and entertainment\n   - Option 3: Cultural tourism (文化旅游) - For learning about history and culture\n   - Option 4: Outdoor tourism (户外旅游) - Not mentioned in the passage\n\n4. **Reasoning about museums:**\n   - Museums are primarily educational institutions that preserve and display historical artifacts, cultural items, art, and knowledge\n   - The main purpose of visiting museums is to learn about history, culture, art, or science\n   - This aligns perfectly with the definition of cultural tourism given in the passage: visiting places \"with the purpose of learning about history and culture\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Visiting museums clearly falls under cultural tourism since the primary motivation is educational - to learn about history, culture, and heritage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses \"reverse culture shock\" - the impact of returning home after living abroad. Key points include:\n\n1. Reverse culture shock hits faster than initial culture shock (shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more severe\n2. For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it's sometimes difficult to readjust to their home culture\n3. After living abroad, people find they've adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from their home culture\n4. When first going abroad, people are patient and understanding because they know travelers need to adapt to a new country\n5. People may not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding when returning home\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, which type of traveler might have more difficulty adapting to the shock of returning home?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. Travelers who experienced particularly bad culture shock - The passage doesn't suggest this group has more difficulty returning\n2. Travelers who could quickly adapt while living abroad - This matches the passage's statement that \"for travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it's sometimes difficult to readjust to their home culture\"\n3. Travelers still in the honeymoon period - The passage mentions the honeymoon period is shorter for reverse culture shock, but doesn't suggest these travelers have more difficulty\n4. Travelers lacking patience - This isn't mentioned as a factor affecting difficulty in readjusting\n\nThe passage explicitly states that travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their home culture, which directly corresponds to option 2.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses boomerang throwing as a popular skill that many tourists want to learn. It provides several key pieces of information:\n\n**Step 2: Identifying key points from the passage**\n- Boomerang throwing is a popular skill tourists want to learn\n- If you want to learn to throw a boomerang that returns to your hand, you must use an appropriate boomerang that can fly back\n- In reality, most boomerangs sold in Australia cannot fly back\n- Beginners should not try throwing boomerangs in strong wind\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"If thrown correctly, it will always return to your hand\" - This contradicts the passage, which states that most boomerangs in Australia cannot fly back, regardless of throwing technique.\n\n2. \"It is more popular among locals than tourists\" - The passage only mentions that it's popular among tourists but doesn't compare popularity between locals and tourists.\n\n3. \"There aren't many boomerangs available in Australia\" - The passage doesn't discuss availability or quantity, only that most available ones don't return.\n\n4. \"Only some boomerangs can return\" - This directly matches the passage's statement that you need to use \"appropriate boomerangs that can fly back\" and that \"most boomerangs sold in Australia cannot fly back,\" implying only some can return.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nOption 4 accurately reflects the main point of the passage about boomerang functionality.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what happened in the described match:\n   - South Africa defeated the All Blacks (New Zealand) 21-20\n   - This ended the All Blacks' 15-game winning streak\n   - The All Blacks had already won the trophy two weeks prior, and this was their final match\n\n2. Now I need to identify what the question is asking:\n   - The question asks which teams will participate in the match at Ellis Park\n\n3. Let me find the relevant information about the Ellis Park match:\n   - The passage states: \"The final match of the series will be held next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where the Springboks will face Australia\"\n\n4. I need to identify who the Springboks are:\n   - From context, the Springboks refer to the South African rugby team (this is their nickname, just like \"All Blacks\" refers to New Zealand)\n\n5. So the Ellis Park match will be between:\n   - Springboks (South Africa) vs Australia\n\n6. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: All Blacks and Australia - Incorrect\n   - Option 2: New Zealand and South Africa - Incorrect  \n   - Option 3: South Africa and Australia - Correct\n   - Option 4: Springboks and All Blacks - Incorrect\n\nThe passage clearly states that the Springboks (South Africa) will face Australia at Ellis Park.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about bow symbols and techniques for string instruments (like violin). Let me break down what it says:\n\n1. The \"up bow\" symbol looks like the letter V\n2. The \"down bow\" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom edge\n3. Up bow means starting to push the bow from the tip\n4. Down bow means starting to pull the bow from the frog (where you hold the bow)\n5. Up bow usually produces a softer sound\n6. Down bow produces a stronger, more firm sound\n7. The passage mentions respecting printed musical notation\n\nNow let me examine each option to see which one is NOT related to \"拉弓\" (pulling the bow/down bow):\n\nOption 1: \"声音更柔和\" (softer sound) - This is associated with UP bow, not down bow (pulling)\n\nOption 2: \"看起来像钉书钉的符号\" (symbol that looks like a staple) - This describes the DOWN bow symbol, which IS related to pulling the bow\n\nOption 3: \"声音更强烈\" (stronger sound) - This is associated with DOWN bow (pulling the bow)\n\nOption 4: \"从弓根处开始\" (starting from the frog) - This describes the DOWN bow technique (pulling the bow)\n\nThe question asks which option is NOT related to \"拉弓\" (pulling the bow/down bow). Option 1 describes the characteristic of up bow (pushing), not down bow (pulling).\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: The passage discusses Haiti's temporary electoral committee (CEP) and political events involving Martelly.\n\n2. **Identifying key information**: \n   - Martelly was sworn into a new 9-member temporary electoral committee (CEP)\n   - This is Martelly's fifth time being selected for Haiti's temporary electoral committee in four years\n   - Last month, the presidential committee recommended that the former CEP resign\n   - This resignation was part of measures to push the country toward new elections\n\n3. **Finding the specific answer**: The passage states \"上个月，总统委员会建议前任 CEP 辞职\" which translates to \"Last month, the presidential committee recommended that the former CEP resign.\"\n\n4. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - Option 1: Martelly - Not mentioned as making this recommendation\n   - Option 2: Protesters - They were protesting but not mentioned as recommending resignation\n   - Option 3: Presidential committee - This matches exactly what the passage states\n   - Option 4: CEP members themselves - Not mentioned in the passage\n\nThe passage clearly states that it was the presidential committee (总统委员会) that recommended the resignation of the former CEP.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: The passage describes an outbreak that started in late July, where pigs carry the disease and mosquitoes transmit it to humans.\n\n2. **Identifying the measures mentioned**: The Indian government took several measures:\n   - Placing pig traps in severely infected areas\n   - Distributing thousands of mosquito nets\n   - Spraying insecticides\n   - Promising to provide millions of doses of encephalitis vaccine\n\n3. **Analyzing the timing of implementation**: \n   - Pig traps, mosquito nets, and insecticides are mentioned as measures that were already taken (\"采取一些措施\")\n   - The vaccine is described differently - the government \"promised to provide\" (\"承诺提供\") millions of doses\n\n4. **Key information about the vaccine timing**:\n   - The vaccine will help medical institutions \"prepare for next year\" (\"为明年做好准备\")\n   - The plan to provide vaccines to historically most affected areas \"was postponed this year\" (\"今年...计划被推迟了\") due to lack of funding and lower priority compared to other diseases\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The encephalitis vaccine is clearly described as being delayed and intended for next year's preparation, making it the measure that will be implemented last, after all the immediate measures (traps, nets, insecticides) that were already put in place.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses nutrition practices for young athletes. It states that:\n- Proper nutrition alone is not enough to create outstanding performance\n- But it can significantly impact young athletes' overall health\n- Maintaining healthy energy balance, effective hydration habits, and understanding proper use of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve performance and increase enjoyment in sports\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, which of the following is NOT a suggestion for young athletes to find more enjoyment in sports?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. \"Practice proper nutrition\" - This IS mentioned as helpful for increasing enjoyment\n2. \"Always maintain outstanding performance\" - This is NOT mentioned as a suggestion. In fact, the passage states that proper nutrition alone is not enough to create outstanding performance\n3. \"Effective hydration\" - This IS mentioned as helpful for increasing enjoyment\n4. \"Maintain healthy energy balance\" - This IS mentioned as helpful for increasing enjoyment\n\nThe passage specifically mentions that maintaining energy balance, effective hydration, and understanding nutritional supplements help increase sports enjoyment. However, it does not suggest that athletes should \"always maintain outstanding performance\" - rather, it acknowledges that outstanding performance cannot be achieved through nutrition alone.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses the transition from quarter-mile to half-mile running, explaining what factors become important for success in half-mile races.\n\n**Key points from the passage:**\n1. When transitioning from quarter-mile to half-mile running, speed becomes less important while endurance becomes absolutely crucial\n2. To become a first-class half-mile runner (completing it within 2 minutes), one must have sufficient speed AND must cultivate endurance at all costs\n3. Winter cross-country running plus upper body fitness training can provide good preparation for the running season\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks what is most important for a first-class half-mile runner.\n\n**Evaluating each option:**\n1. \"Practicing cross-country running in winter\" - This is mentioned as helpful preparation, but not as the most important factor\n2. \"Cultivating endurance rather than speed\" - The passage emphasizes endurance as \"absolutely important\" and says it must be cultivated \"at all costs,\" while speed becomes \"less important\"\n3. \"Completing it within 2 minutes\" - This is mentioned as a benchmark for first-class runners, but it's a result/goal rather than what's most important to achieve\n4. \"Cultivating speed rather than endurance\" - This contradicts the passage, which clearly states endurance becomes more important than speed\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe passage clearly emphasizes that endurance becomes the absolutely crucial factor for half-mile running, while speed becomes less important. Option 2 directly reflects this key message.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the context**\nThe passage discusses primates in tropical grasslands who have human-like digestive systems and face challenges meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the problem**\n- Plant resources are insufficient for primates' amino acid requirements\n- Failure to meet these needs leads to: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and eventually death\n- The most available plant proteins are from leaves and legumes, but primates like humans cannot digest these well unless cooked\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the solution presented**\nThe passage states that animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are:\n- Easy to digest\n- Provide abundant protein\n- Contain all essential amino acids\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the options**\n1. 枯萎的叶子 (withered leaves) - This is plant material, which the passage says is hard to digest\n2. 生的豆科植物 (raw legumes) - The passage specifically mentions legumes are hard to digest unless cooked\n3. 蚂蚱 (grasshoppers) - This is an animal food source, similar to the ants and termites mentioned as good protein sources\n4. 花茎 (flower stems) - This is plant material, which would have the same digestibility issues\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly indicates that animal foods are the solution to the \"protein problem\" for primates. Among the options, only grasshoppers (蚂蚱) represent an animal food source that would be easy to digest and provide complete amino acids, similar to the ants, termites, and eggs mentioned in the text.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The passage discusses how when you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites\n   - Satellites in space receive the phone call and almost immediately reflect it back\n   - Satellites are launched into space by rockets\n   - Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light and vision\n   - To send satellites or telescopes into space requires giant rockets over 100 feet tall\n\n2. **Understanding the question:**\n   The question asks: \"Which of the following reflects long-distance phone calls back to Earth?\"\n\n3. **Analyzing the options:**\n   - Option 1: Telescope - The passage mentions telescopes are used for observation due to atmospheric distortion, not for phone calls\n   - Option 2: Satellite - The passage explicitly states that satellites in space receive phone calls and reflect them back\n   - Option 3: Light - Light is mentioned in context of being distorted by atmosphere, not reflecting phone calls\n   - Option 4: Rocket - Rockets are mentioned as the means to launch satellites and telescopes, not for reflecting calls\n\n4. **Finding the answer:**\n   The passage clearly states: \"太空中的卫星接到电话后，几乎是立刻将其反射回去\" (Satellites in space receive phone calls and almost immediately reflect them back)\n\nThis directly answers the question about what reflects long-distance phone calls back to Earth.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses the gravitational effects of Io (Jupiter's moon) on a person. It states:\n- If you stand on Io's surface, you would weigh less than on Earth\n- A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io\n- Therefore, gravity naturally exerts a smaller pulling force on you\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the key information**\n- On Earth: 200 pounds\n- On Io: 36 pounds\n- This means Io's gravity is much weaker than Earth's gravity\n- The gravitational pull on Io is smaller, which is why you weigh less there\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating each option**\n1. \"Earth has less pulling force on you than Io\" - This is INCORRECT. Earth has more pulling force.\n2. \"Io's pulling force is greater, which is why you would be lighter\" - This is INCORRECT. Greater pulling force would make you heavier, not lighter.\n3. \"Io's pulling force is greater, which is why you would be heavier\" - This is INCORRECT. The passage says you're lighter on Io, not heavier.\n4. \"Earth has greater pulling force on you than Io\" - This is CORRECT. Earth's stronger gravity (200 lbs vs 36 lbs) means Earth exerts greater gravitational force.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly indicates that Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's gravity, as evidenced by the significant difference in weight (200 lbs on Earth vs 36 lbs on Io).\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: This passage describes an incident involving a photographer who was hit by a car and later died at UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. The photographer was in his 20s, and Justin Bieber issued a statement about the tragic accident.\n\n2. **Identifying what the photographer was doing**: According to the TMZ report mentioned in the passage, the photographer:\n   - Parked on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard\n   - Started photographing a police traffic stop\n   - Crossed the road and continued taking photos\n   - This caused the California Highway Patrol officers conducting the traffic stop to stop their work twice to order him back to the other side\n\n3. **Analyzing the question**: The question asks \"What was this photographer trying to do before being hit by the car?\"\n\n4. **Evaluating the options**:\n   - Option 1: \"Park on Sepulveda Boulevard\" - This happened earlier, but wasn't what he was doing immediately before being hit\n   - Option 2: \"Photograph the police traffic stop\" - This is exactly what the passage describes he was doing throughout the incident\n   - Option 3: \"Cross the busy highway\" - While he did cross the road, this was a means to continue photographing, not the primary goal\n   - Option 4: \"Persuade police to let him continue photographing\" - The passage doesn't mention him trying to persuade anyone\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The photographer's primary activity and intention throughout the incident was to photograph the police traffic stop, which he continued doing even after crossing the road.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya issued a warning\n   - \"Somali extremists\" are planning suicide bomb attacks\n   - The attacks are planned in Kenya and Ethiopia\n   - The US received information from an anonymous source\n   - The information specifically mentions using suicide bombers to target \"famous landmarks\" in Ethiopia and Kenya\n\n2. **Analyzing the key details:**\n   - **Number of countries involved:** Two countries (Kenya and Ethiopia)\n   - **Type of targets:** \"Famous landmarks\" (著名地标)\n   - **Method:** Suicide bomb attacks\n\n3. **Examining each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"Detonate bombs at landmarks in one country\" - This is incorrect because the passage mentions TWO countries (Kenya and Ethiopia)\n   - Option 2: \"Detonate bombs in two countries\" - This mentions the correct number of countries but doesn't specify that landmarks are the targets\n   - Option 3: \"Detonate bombs at landmarks in two countries\" - This correctly identifies both the number of countries (two) AND that the targets are landmarks\n   - Option 4: \"Detonate bombs in one country\" - This is incorrect because it mentions only one country when the passage clearly states two\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Option 3 most accurately describes the extremists' alleged attack plan as it includes both key elements: the involvement of two countries (Kenya and Ethiopia) and the specific targeting of landmarks.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage describes Kirby Muxloe Castle as a typical building of its time period. Key points:\n\n1. It's described as more of a \"fortified house\" rather than a true castle\n2. It had large glass windows and thin walls that couldn't withstand a determined attack for long\n3. It was built in the 1480s by Lord Hastings\n4. The country was relatively peaceful at that time\n5. It only needed to defend against small groups of wandering raiders\n\n**Question:** Which of the following is an accurate description of Kirby Muxloe Castle?\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nOption 1: \"This castle's thick walls were built at Lord Hastings' request\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which states the castle had \"thin walls\" (薄墙), not thick walls.\n\nOption 2: \"Due to the peaceful nature of the country at that time, it required minimal fortifications\"\n- This aligns with the passage. It states the country was \"relatively peaceful\" and only needed defense against \"small groups of wandering raiders,\" which explains why minimal fortifications were sufficient.\n\nOption 3: \"The construction of this castle did not conform to the typical style of that time\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which explicitly states it was \"typical architecture of that period\" (那段时期的典型建筑).\n\nOption 4: \"It was built to withstand long-term determined attacks\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which clearly states the thin walls and large windows \"could not resist a determined attack for a long time.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption 2 is the only one that accurately reflects the information in the passage about the castle's minimal defensive needs due to the peaceful conditions of the time.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the main content**: The passage discusses the Komen Foundation's new policy and its impact on Planned Parenthood funding.\n\n2. **Identifying the key policy**: Leslie Aun, spokesperson for the Komen Foundation, states that the organization adopted a new rule that prohibits providing funding to organizations that are under legal investigation.\n\n3. **Understanding the consequence**: This Komen policy has put Planned Parenthood's program on hold because they are waiting for the results of an investigation into Planned Parenthood's funding expenditures and reporting.\n\n4. **Identifying who is conducting the investigation**: Representative Cliff Stearns, who is the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee under the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is currently investigating whether tax money is being used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood.\n\n5. **Answering the question**: The question asks \"Which organization is under legal investigation?\" Based on the passage, it's clear that Planned Parenthood (计划生育计划) is the organization being investigated by Congressman Stearns regarding the use of tax money for abortion funding.\n\n6. **Verification**: The passage explicitly states that Komen's policy affects Planned Parenthood because Planned Parenthood is under investigation, and that Stearns is investigating whether tax money is being used through Planned Parenthood to fund abortions.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - Triceratops had teeth that could bite through not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots\n   - Some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which were common plants in the Cretaceous period\n   - These plants looked like small palm trees with crowns made of nail-like sharp leaves\n   - Before eating the trunk, Triceratops would use its powerful beak to strip away the leaves\n   - Other scientists think these plants were poisonous, so dinosaurs probably wouldn't eat them\n\n2. **Analyzing the question:**\n   The question asks: \"According to this passage, which part of the cycad plant might Triceratops eat?\"\n\n3. **Examining each option:**\n   - Option 1 (nail-like leaves): The passage says Triceratops would strip away the leaves BEFORE eating the trunk, implying the leaves were removed, not eaten\n   - Option 2 (trunk/stem): The passage specifically states \"Before eating the trunk, Triceratops would use its powerful beak to strip away the leaves\" - this directly indicates they ate the trunk\n   - Option 3 (roots): While the passage mentions Triceratops could bite through roots, it doesn't specifically mention eating cycad roots\n   - Option 4 (fruit): Fruit is not mentioned in relation to what Triceratops ate from cycads\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The passage clearly states that Triceratops would strip away the leaves before eating the trunk, which directly indicates that the trunk was the part they consumed.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage describes Goma, a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Key points include:\n\n1. Goma is located in eastern Congo, near Rwanda\n2. In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Nyiragongo volcano\n3. While Goma is relatively safe, travelers should investigate conditions outside the city due to ongoing fighting in North Kivu province\n4. The city serves as a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and offers Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla tracking\n5. Tourists can use boda-boda (rental motorcycles) to get around, with local prices around 500 Congolese francs for short trips\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following is NOT good advice for tourists visiting Goma?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\n1. \"The fighting in North Kivu is interesting\" - This suggests tourists should be interested in or seek out the fighting, which contradicts the passage's warning that travelers should investigate conditions and be cautious about the ongoing conflict. This is clearly bad advice.\n\n2. \"It's a good place for cheap mountain gorilla tracking\" - The passage explicitly states this is true, so this IS good advice.\n\n3. \"Rental motorcycles are a good transportation method\" - The passage mentions boda-boda as a way to tour Goma, so this IS good advice.\n\n4. \"The base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano is located in the city\" - The passage states the city serves as a base for climbing the volcano, so this IS good advice.\n\nOption 1 is the only statement that represents bad advice, as it encourages interest in dangerous fighting rather than caution.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses how to travel the world with minimal money. It mentions two main approaches:\n1. Working while traveling\n2. Minimizing expenses\n\nThe text focuses on the second approach and refers to a \"Minimum Budget Travel Guide\" for those who are willing to sacrifice comfort and time, enjoy surprising travels, and reduce expenses to nearly zero.\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, who might find it difficult to travel on an extremely limited budget?\"\n\n**Examining each option:**\n\n1. \"People who like to accept challenges\" - The passage actually mentions that budget travel is suitable for those who want to \"challenge themselves\" (挑战自我), so this group would likely do well with limited budget travel.\n\n2. \"People without strict time constraints\" - The passage states that budget travelers should be willing to \"sacrifice time\" (牺牲时间), implying that having flexible time is actually beneficial for budget travel.\n\n3. \"People planning to work remotely during travel\" - The passage mentions \"working while traveling\" as one of the two main approaches to budget travel, so this would actually help with limited budgets.\n\n4. \"People who like to follow itineraries\" - The passage emphasizes that budget travelers should enjoy \"travels full of surprises\" (充满惊喜的旅行) and be willing to sacrifice comfort and time. Following strict itineraries would conflict with the flexibility and adaptability required for extremely budget travel.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPeople who prefer structured, planned itineraries would find it most difficult to travel on extremely limited budgets because such travel requires flexibility, adaptability, and willingness to embrace unexpected situations.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses the differences between French spoken in Belgium/Switzerland versus France. Key points:\n\n1. Belgian and Swiss French are very similar to French French and mutually intelligible, but have slight differences\n2. Specifically mentioned differences:\n   - Number systems have subtle peculiarities \n   - Some words have slightly different pronunciation\n3. All French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn standard French in school\n4. Even if you use the standard French measurement system, they can understand it\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following is different in France compared to Belgium or Switzerland?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\n1. \"All word pronunciation\" - The passage says \"some words\" have different pronunciation, not \"all words.\" This is too broad.\n\n2. \"Measurement system\" - The passage mentions that Belgian/Swiss French has differences in the \"number system\" (数字系统), and that even if you use the \"standard French measurement system\" (标准的法国度量系统), they can understand it. This implies there are differences in measurement systems.\n\n3. \"Standard French taught in schools\" - The passage explicitly states that all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn the same standard French in school, so this is NOT different.\n\n4. \"Spelling of some French words\" - The passage mentions pronunciation differences but does not mention spelling differences.\n\nThe passage specifically mentions differences in the number/measurement system between these regions, and implies that France uses a \"standard\" system while Belgium/Switzerland have their own variations.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to identify what caused the phase change mentioned in the question.\n\n2. Looking at the passage, it states: \"导致相位变化的重大地震活动于 3 月 10 日发生在该火山顶部火山口的东北侧\" which translates to \"The major seismic activity that caused the phase change occurred on March 10th on the northeast side of the volcanic crater at the top of the volcano.\"\n\n3. This sentence directly tells us that the seismic activity that caused the phase change happened on March 10th.\n\n4. Since the seismic activity that caused the phase change occurred on March 10th, the phase change itself would have occurred on March 10th (as it was caused by the seismic activity on that date).\n\n5. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: Before March 10th\n   - Option 2: Past 48 hours\n   - Option 3: March 10th\n   - Option 4: The previous week\n\n6.

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses the concept of time and how it affects everything we do, though it's difficult to understand. It mentions that time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years. The passage explains that:\n\n1. Time is experienced as a series of events flowing from future to present to past\n2. Time is used to compare the duration/length of events\n3. We can record the passage of time by observing repetitive, cyclical events\n4. Cyclical events are defined as things that happen regularly, again and again\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"In order to record the passage of time, what aspects of cyclical events should be noted?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. 持续时间 (Duration) - While duration is mentioned in the passage as something we use time to compare, it's not specifically what we should note about cyclical events for recording time's passage.\n\n2. 重复 (Repetition) - The passage explicitly states that cyclical events are those that happen \"regularly, again and again\" (有规律地一次又一次发生). The key characteristic that makes these events useful for recording time is their repetitive nature.\n\n3. 影响 (Impact/Influence) - The passage mentions time influences everything we do, but this isn't what we should note about cyclical events specifically.\n\n4. 难度 (Difficulty) - The passage mentions time is difficult to understand, but this isn't related to what we should observe about cyclical events.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe passage clearly emphasizes that cyclical events are useful for recording time's passage because they occur \"regularly, again and again.\" The repetitive nature is the key aspect that should be noted.\n\n2",

It does not discuss the causes or reasons for the 1967 war.\n\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, which of the following issues is NOT included in this document?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Jerusalem's future - This IS mentioned in the document\n2. Causes of the 1967 war - This is NOT mentioned in the document\n3. Military forces in the valley - This IS mentioned in the document  \n4. Border disputes - This IS mentioned in the document\n\nTherefore, the causes of the 1967 war is the only topic not included in the document.\n\n2",

This is Martelly's 5th time being selected for Haiti's temporary election committee in 4 years\n3. Last month, the presidential committee recommended the former CEP resign as part of measures to push the country toward new elections\n4. This committee was Martelly's response to large-scale anti-government protests that began in October\n5. Since 2011, these protests were triggered by some elections failing to be held on schedule, and sometimes escalated to violence\n\nNow let me examine each option to find which statement about the protests is INCORRECT:\n\nOption 1: \"The presidential committee was a response to the protests\"\n- The passage states the committee was Martelly's response to protests - this is CORRECT\n\nOption 2: \"Delayed elections triggered the protests\" \n- The passage says protests were triggered by elections failing to be held on schedule since 2011 - this is CORRECT\n\nOption 3: \"The protests demanded the former CEP resign\"\n- The passage says the presidential committee (not the protests) recommended the former CEP resign. The protests were anti-government protests, but there's no direct statement that the protests specifically demanded CEP resignation - this appears INCORRECT\n\nOption 4: \"The protests were sometimes violent\"\n- The passage explicitly states protests sometimes escalated to violence - this is CORRECT\n\nOption 3 is the incorrect statement because the passage doesn't say the protests directly demanded CEP resignation - rather, it was the presidential committee that recommended the resignation as part of the response to protests.\n\n3",

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses avalanches and their triggering factors. Let me break down the key information:\n\n1. Avalanches are not abnormal phenomena - steep slopes can only hold a limited amount of snow, and excess snow falls as avalanches.\n\n2. The problem is that snow has strong adhesive properties (stickiness), so triggering factors are needed to cause snowfall.\n\n3. Once some snow falls, it can trigger other snow to fall as well.\n\n4. The passage then lists several triggering factors:\n   - Sometimes the sun warming the snow\n   - Sometimes additional snowfall\n   - Sometimes other natural events\n   - But more commonly, human factors\n\nNow let me examine each option:\n\nOption 1: 粘雪 (sticky/adhesive snow) - The passage states that snow has strong adhesive properties, but this is described as the reason WHY triggering factors are needed, not as a triggering factor itself. The stickiness is what prevents avalanches from happening naturally.\n\nOption 2: 人类 (humans) - The passage explicitly mentions \"人为因素\" (human factors) as the most common cause.\n\nOption 3: 阳光 (sunlight) - The passage mentions \"太阳让雪变暖\" (sun warming the snow) as a triggering factor.\n\nOption 4: 额外的降雪 (additional snowfall) - The passage mentions \"降雪多了些\" (more snowfall) as a triggering factor.\n\nThe question asks which is NOT a triggering factor for avalanches. Based on the analysis, sticky snow is described as a property that prevents avalanches (requiring triggers to overcome it), rather than being a trigger itself.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage**: The passage discusses famous Greek figures including politicians, scientists, and artists.\n\n2. **Key information about Homer**: The passage specifically mentions Homer as \"有着传奇色彩的盲人诗人荷马\" which translates to \"the legendary blind poet Homer.\"\n\n3. **The crucial detail**: The word \"盲人\" means \"blind person\" - this is the key information that answers the question.\n\n4. **Understanding the question**: \"希腊诗人荷马无法做什么？\" translates to \"What was the Greek poet Homer unable to do?\"\n\n5. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - Option 1: 听 (hear/listen)\n   - Option 2: 看 (see/look)\n   - Option 3: 走 (walk)\n   - Option 4: 说 (speak/talk)\n\n6. **Making the connection**: Since Homer is described as blind (\"盲人\"), he would be unable to see. Blindness specifically refers to the inability to see, not to hear, walk, or speak.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The passage clearly states Homer was blind, which means he could not see.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage discusses airlines like Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, and Turkish Airlines that have expanded their services to Africa, offering competitive prices and routes to major African cities. It mentions that Turkish Airlines serves 39 destinations in 30 African countries since 2014.\n\nThe key sentence for answering the question is: \"对于非洲以外的所有地区，别忘了加上额外的签证费、离境税、地面交通等费用\" which translates to \"For all regions outside of Africa, don't forget to add extra visa fees, departure taxes, ground transportation and other costs.\"\n\nThe question asks: \"When comparing total Africa ticket prices with round-the-world travel ticket prices, which item does NOT need to be added?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. Extra visa fees for regions outside Africa - The passage says to add these for regions outside Africa\n2. Africa departure tax fees - The passage mentions departure taxes for regions outside Africa, not specifically Africa departure taxes\n3. Africa visa fees - The passage doesn't mention adding Africa visa fees specifically\n4. Ground transportation fees for regions outside Africa - The passage says to add these for regions outside Africa\n\nThe passage specifically states that for regions \"outside of Africa\" (非洲以外), you need to add extra visa fees, departure taxes, and ground transportation costs. This implies these are costs for non-African portions of a round-the-world trip.\n\nThe passage does not mention adding Africa visa fees when comparing Africa total ticket prices with round-the-world travel prices.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about Hu Jintao's statements regarding carbon dioxide emissions reduction. Let me identify what he mentioned:\n\n1. **Timeline**: He mentioned \"by 2020\" (到2020年之前) as the target date for achieving significant reduction in CO2 emissions per unit of GDP compared to 2005.\n\n2. **Reduction amounts**: The passage explicitly states \"He did not set a reduction amount\" (他没有设定削减数额), only saying the amount would be determined based on China's economic output.\n\n3. **Basis for reduction**: He mentioned that the reduction would be based on China's economic output (将根据中国的经济产出来决定数额).\n\n4. **Advice for developing countries**: He encouraged developing countries \"not to repeat the old path of polluting first and treating later\" (不要重走先污染后治理的老路).\n\nNow let me check what he did NOT mention according to the options:\n\n1. 减排的基础 (Basis for reduction) - He DID mention this (economic output)\n2. 针对发展中国家的污染建议 (Pollution advice for developing countries) - He DID mention this\n3. 二氧化碳排放有望削减的日期 (Date when CO2 emissions are expected to be reduced) - He DID mention this (by 2020)\n4. 二氧化碳排放削减数额 (CO2 emission reduction amounts) - He did NOT mention specific amounts\n\nThe passage clearly states that Hu did not set specific reduction amounts, only that they would be determined based on economic output.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - Babylonians built main temples for each deity, considering them as the gods' residences\n   - People would offer sacrifices to gods, and priests would satisfy gods' needs through rituals and festivals\n   - Each temple had an open courtyard accessible to the public, and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter\n   - Some special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples\n   - The top of towers was a special sacred place for gods\n\n2. **Analyzing the key restriction:**\n   The passage clearly states that temples had two areas:\n   - An open courtyard (对外开放的庭院) - accessible to the public\n   - An inner sanctuary (内殿) - only priests could enter (只有祭司才能进入)\n\n3. **Examining each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"Offering sacrifices in the temple courtyard\" - This is possible since the courtyard is open to the public\n   - Option 2: \"Participating in rituals in the main temple\" - This is possible since people participated in rituals\n   - Option 3: \"In festivals in the temple courtyard\" - This is possible since festivals occurred and courtyards were open\n   - Option 4: \"Offering sacrifices in the inner sanctuary\" - This is NOT possible since only priests could enter the inner sanctuary\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The passage explicitly states that only priests could enter the inner sanctuary, so ordinary Babylonians could not appear there to offer sacrifices.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The passage describes what happens when a light bulb stops working after hundreds of hours of use\n   - It explains the process of replacing a burned-out bulb and safety precautions\n\n2. **Identifying the key information about why bulbs stop working:**\n   - The first sentence states: \"使用几百个小时后，灯丝最终被烧坏，而灯泡也不亮了\" (After using for hundreds of hours, the filament is eventually burned out, and the bulb no longer lights up)\n   - This directly explains the cause of bulb failure\n\n3. **Analyzing the rest of the passage:**\n   - The remaining text discusses safety procedures for replacing bulbs\n   - It mentions turning off switches and disconnecting cables\n   - It warns about electrical shock risks\n   - These are safety measures, not causes of bulb failure\n\n4. **Evaluating each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"灯具未正确关闭\" (Light fixture not properly turned off) - This is about safety during replacement, not the cause of failure\n   - Option 2: \"灯泡的金属底部只部分插入插座\" (Metal base of bulb only partially inserted into socket) - This is about improper installation, not natural failure\n   - Option 3: \"灯泡内部的灯丝烧坏\" (Filament inside the bulb burns out) - This directly matches what the passage states as the cause\n   - Option 4: \"电流进入插座的流量减缓\" (Current flow into socket slows down) - This is not mentioned as a cause of failure\n\nThe passage clearly states that the filament burns out after hundreds of hours of use, which is what causes the bulb to stop working.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the dress code**: The passage describes clothing requirements for visiting monasteries:\n   - Women must wear skirts that reach the knee and cover shoulders\n   - Men must wear long pants that cover the knees\n\n2. **What monasteries provide**: The passage mentions that monasteries offer clothing for unprepared visitors:\n   - They provide wrap-around garments (裹身衣) for women who don't have appropriate clothing\n   - They have storage lockers at the entrance where you can borrow clothing\n   - Long pants are available for men to borrow\n\n3. **Analyzing each option**:\n   - **Option 1 (裙子 - skirts)**: The passage mentions that skirts are available from storage lockers, so these can be borrowed\n   - **Option 2 (短裤 - shorts)**: Shorts would violate the dress code since they don't cover the knees. The monastery wouldn't provide clothing that goes against their own requirements\n   - **Option 3 (长裤 - long pants)**: The passage explicitly states that long pants can be borrowed from entrance lockers\n   - **Option 4 (裹身衣 - wrap-around garments)**: The passage specifically mentions that most monasteries provide these for women\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since shorts don't meet the knee-covering requirement that the monastery enforces, they would not provide shorts for borrowing. This would contradict their own dress code.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The competition started at 10 AM with good weather (light rain that cleared up quickly)\n   - This was perfect weather for seven-a-side rugby\n   - South Africa (top seed) had a good start, easily defeating Zambia (5th seed) 26-0\n   - In the match against their \"southern sister team,\" South Africa looked rusty at first\n   - However, South Africa's performance steadily improved as the match progressed\n   - They stood out due to their strict defense, ball control skills, and excellent teamwork\n   - They were described as an unbeatable team\n\n2. **Analyzing the question:**\n   The question asks: \"According to this passage, when did South Africa's performance start to improve?\"\n\n3. **Examining each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"Around 10 AM\" - This refers to when the competition started, not when improvement began\n   - Option 2: \"After strengthening defense\" - The passage mentions their defense as a strength, but doesn't say improvement came after strengthening defense\n   - Option 3: \"After losing to Zambia\" - This is incorrect; South Africa won against Zambia 26-0\n   - Option 4: \"As the match progressed\" - This directly matches the text: \"但随着比赛的进行，南非队的表现稳步改进\" (but as the match progressed, South Africa's performance steadily improved)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The passage clearly states that South Africa looked rusty at first in their match against the \"southern sister team,\" but their performance steadily improved as the match progressed.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses 20th-century research on genetic variation. It explains that:\n- There are two pools of genetic variation: dominant and recessive\n- Mutations add new genetic variations\n- Selection removes variations from the expressed genetic variation pool\n- Due to segregation and recombination, variations move back and forth between the two pools in each generation\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"Which process adds new genetic variations?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. 分离 (Segregation) - The passage mentions this causes variations to move between pools, but doesn't add new variations\n2. 重组 (Recombination) - The passage mentions this causes variations to move between pools, but doesn't add new variations\n3. 突变 (Mutation) - The passage explicitly states \"突变会添加新的基因变异\" (mutations add new genetic variations)\n4. 显性 (Dominance) - This refers to a type of genetic variation pool, not a process that adds variations\n\n**Step 4: Finding the answer**\nThe passage clearly states that mutations add new genetic variations. Segregation and recombination only move existing variations between pools, while dominance is a characteristic of genetic variations, not a process.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about Bobek, a football player. Here's what it tells us:\n\n1. Bobek was born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia\n2. He became famous while playing for Belgrade Partizan football club\n3. He joined the team in 1945 and played until 1958\n4. During his time with the team, he appeared in 468 matches and scored 403 goals\n5. No one has more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek\n6. In 1995, he was elected as the best player in Partizan's history\n\nNow let me examine each option:\n\nOption 1: \"He started playing for Partizan in 1945\"\n- The passage clearly states \"他于 1945 年加入球队\" (he joined the team in 1945)\n- This is directly supported by the text\n\nOption 2: \"He played for Zagreb before Belgrade Partizan\"\n- The passage only mentions he was born in Zagreb, but doesn't say he played for a Zagreb team before Partizan\n- This is not supported by the text\n\nOption 3: \"He continued playing for Partizan until before 1995\"\n- The passage states he played from 1945 to 1958, which ended long before 1995\n- This is incorrect\n\nOption 4: \"He became famous because he was elected as Partizan's best player\"\n- The passage states he became famous while playing for Partizan, and separately mentions he was elected best player in 1995\n- The timeline suggests he became famous during his playing career (1945-1958), not because of the 1995 election\n- This is not supported by the text\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses how children can become aware of race and racial stereotypes at a young age, and how these stereotypes affect their behavior. It provides a specific example: if people have stereotypical beliefs that children from certain minority ethnic groups perform poorly in school, then once these children learn about the stereotypical views regarding their own ethnicity, they often do indeed perform poorly in school.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the key relationship**\nThe passage establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship:\n- Cause: Children learning about racial stereotypes concerning their own ethnic group\n- Effect: These stereotypes influence their actual behavior (specifically academic performance in the example given)\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, a child's understanding of racial stereotypes might have an impact on which of the following aspects?\"\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating each option**\n1. \"The minority ethnicity they choose to identify with\" - The passage doesn't discuss children choosing or changing their ethnic identity\n2. \"Their behavior\" - This directly matches what the passage states: stereotypes \"affect their behavior\" and the example shows how awareness of stereotypes leads to poor academic performance (a behavioral outcome)\n3. \"Their relationships with other children\" - The passage doesn't mention interpersonal relationships\n4. \"Their definition of race\" - The passage doesn't discuss how children define or conceptualize race\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage explicitly states that racial stereotypes \"affect their behavior\" (影响其行为) and provides a concrete example of this behavioral impact through academic performance.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage states: \"This is eBay's largest acquisition in history. The company hopes to diversify its profit sources and increase its visibility in regions where Skype is widely popular, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\"\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\nThe question asks: \"What is the purpose of eBay's acquisition?\"\n\n**Analyzing Each Option:**\n1. \"Consolidate its revenue\" - This doesn't match the passage, which mentions diversifying (not consolidating) profit sources\n2. \"Expand to new areas/fields\" - This aligns with diversifying profit sources and expanding to new geographical regions\n3. \"Increase visibility\" - This is mentioned in the passage but only as one aspect, not the complete purpose\n4. \"Meet shareholders' requirements\" - This is not mentioned anywhere in the passage\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe passage explicitly states two main purposes:\n- Diversify profit sources (实现利润来源的多元化)\n- Increase visibility in specific regions (在...等地区提高知名度)\n\nThe diversification of profit sources indicates eBay wants to expand into new business areas/fields beyond their current operations. While increasing visibility is mentioned, it's specifically about geographical expansion, which is part of the broader goal of expanding to new areas.\n\nOption 2 \"expand to new areas/fields\" best captures the overall strategic purpose described in the passage.\n\n2"

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Location and seasons**: Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo, and vice versa.\n\n2. **Climate description**: Montevideo is in the subtropics.\n\n3. **Summer conditions**: During summer months, temperatures over +30°C are common.\n\n4. **Winter conditions**: Winter can be deceptively cool. Temperatures rarely go below freezing, BUT wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.\n\n5. **Rainfall**: There are no distinct wet or dry seasons - precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.\n\n6. **The question**: When should travelers visit Montevideo if they want to avoid wind?\n\nNow let me evaluate the options:\n\n- Option 1: During winter months in the northern hemisphere = summer in Montevideo\n- Option 2: During dry season in Montevideo = this doesn't exist according to the passage\n- Option 3: During summer months in the northern hemisphere = winter in Montevideo\n- Option 4: During winter months in Montevideo\n\nThe key information is that during Montevideo's winter, \"wind and humidity lead to it feeling colder than what the thermometer shows.\" This specifically mentions wind as a problem during winter.\n\nTherefore, to avoid wind, travelers should visit during Montevideo's summer, which corresponds to winter in the northern hemisphere.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage describes the Amazon River and provides several key facts about it:\n\n1. The Amazon is the second-longest river on Earth (\"Der Amazonas ist der zweitlängste... Fluss der Erde\")\n2. It is the most water-rich river on Earth (\"wasserreichste Fluss der Erde\")\n3. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river\n4. It is the widest river on Earth (\"der breiteste Fluss der Erde\"), sometimes up to six miles wide\n5. 20% of all river water flowing into the oceans comes from the Amazon\n6. The main Amazon stream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long\n7. It takes in water from thousands of smaller rivers\n\nThe question asks: \"What does NOT apply to the Amazon?\" (Was trifft auf den Amazonas nicht zu?)\n\nLet me check each option:\n\n1. \"Er ist der zweitlängste Fluss\" (It is the second-longest river) - This IS true according to the passage\n2. \"Er ist der größte Fluss\" (It is the largest river) - This IS true in terms of water volume, as stated in the passage\n3. \"Er ist der längste Fluss\" (It is the longest river) - This is NOT true according to the passage, which specifically states it is the SECOND-longest\n4. \"Er ist der breiteste Fluss\" (It is the widest river) - This IS true according to the passage\n\nThe question asks what does NOT apply, so I need to find the false statement. Option 3 claims the Amazon is the longest river, but the passage clearly states it is the second-longest.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses precautions needed when traveling through rainforests, particularly regarding mosquitoes. It states:\n- Especially in summer, you must be careful of mosquitoes when hiking through the rainforest\n- Even when driving through subtropical rainforest, just a few seconds with open doors while getting in is enough to bring mosquitoes into the car\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the passage, what should you NOT do to avoid mosquitoes during a drive through the rainforest?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"Leave the car doors open too long\" - The passage specifically mentions that even a few seconds with open doors is enough to let mosquitoes in, implying you shouldn't leave doors open long\n2. \"Drive during summer months\" - The passage mentions summer as when you need to be careful, but doesn't say to avoid driving then\n3. \"Drive through subtropical areas\" - The passage mentions subtropical rainforest but doesn't suggest avoiding these areas\n4. \"Leave the vehicle unattended during hikes\" - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all\n\n**Key insight:**\nThe passage directly addresses the issue of open car doors allowing mosquitoes to enter the vehicle. This is the only specific behavior the passage warns against when driving through the rainforest.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage is about: The passage describes golf as a game where players use clubs to get balls into holes.\n\n2. Key information about golf rules:\n   - A normal round consists of eighteen holes\n   - Players typically start at the first hole and end at the eighteenth\n   - The game is played on grass/turf\n   - The grass around the hole is cut shorter and called \"the green\"\n\n3. Most importantly for the question, the passage states: \"Der Spieler, der die wenigsten Schläge oder Schwünge mit dem Schläger braucht, um den Kurs abzuschließen, gewinnt.\"\n   This translates to: \"The player who needs the fewest strokes or swings with the club to complete the course wins.\"\n\n4. Now looking at the question: \"Das Ziel beim Golf ist es, die geringste Menge wovon zu erreichen?\"\n   This asks: \"The goal in golf is to achieve the smallest amount of what?\"\n\n5. Analyzing the options:\n   - Option 1: Bälle (balls) - No, you need balls to play\n   - Option 2: Schläge (strokes/hits) - Yes, this matches what the passage says about needing the fewest strokes to win\n   - Option 3: Zeit (time) - Not mentioned as a winning criterion\n   - Option 4: Löcher (holes) - No, you play all 18 holes\n\nThe passage clearly states that the winner is determined by who uses the fewest strokes/swings to complete the course.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage describes an incident where Christopher Garcia, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department, said that a suspected male perpetrator is being investigated for trespassing rather than vandalism. The writing/sign was not physically damaged. The change was made using black tarps that were printed with peace signs and hearts to change the \"O\" into a small \"e\".\n\n**Understanding the question:**\n\"Was tat der Verdächtige nicht, als er das Zeichen änderte?\" means \"What did the suspect NOT do when he changed the sign?\"\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n1. \"Einen Buchstaben ändern\" (Change a letter) - The passage states he changed an \"O\" to an \"e\", so he DID change a letter.\n\n2. \"Es mit einem Friedenszeichen verzieren\" (Decorate it with a peace sign) - The passage mentions the tarps were printed with peace signs, so he DID use peace signs.\n\n3. \"Es physisch beschädigen\" (Physically damage it) - The passage explicitly states \"Der Schriftzug wurde nicht physisch beschädigt\" (The writing was not physically damaged), so he did NOT physically damage it.\n\n4. \"Planen benutzen, um es zu ändern\" (Use tarps to change it) - The passage clearly states he used black tarps, so he DID use tarps.\n\nThe question asks what the suspect did NOT do. Based on the passage, the only thing he did not do was physically damage the sign.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses two main points:\n1. Historians have criticized the FBI's past policy of focusing resources on easily solvable cases (particularly car theft cases) in order to increase the agency's success rate.\n2. Congress began funding an anti-obscenity initiative in August 2005, which mandated that the FBI must deploy 10 agents for adult pornography cases.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"What must the FBI do due to the anti-obscenity initiative?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"Focus more resources on cases of stolen vehicles\" - This refers to the historical criticism mentioned in the first part, not the anti-obscenity initiative.\n\n2. \"Increase the success rate of the agency\" - This was the goal of the old criticized policy, not specifically what the anti-obscenity initiative requires.\n\n3. \"Focus on crimes that should be easy to solve\" - Again, this refers to the historical criticism, not the specific requirement of the anti-obscenity initiative.\n\n4. \"Deploy agents on pornography cases\" - This directly corresponds to what the passage states about the anti-obscenity initiative: \"das FBI 10 Agenten für die Erwachsenenpornographie einsetzen muss\" (the FBI must deploy 10 agents for adult pornography).\n\nThe question specifically asks about the anti-obscenity initiative's requirements, and the passage clearly states that this initiative mandates the FBI to deploy agents for adult pornography cases.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses a debate triggered by controversy over spending for emergency aid and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina. It mentions two groups with different criticisms:\n\n1. Fiscal conservatives who humorously called the spending \"Bush's New Orleans Deal\"\n2. Liberals whose criticism focused on reconstruction contracts being awarded to supposed Washington insiders\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"Who criticizes the reconstruction contracts for emergency aid after Hurricane Katrina?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. Fiscal conservatives (Fiskalisch Konservative) - The passage says they criticized the spending/expenses, calling it \"Bush's New Orleans Deal\"\n2. Liberals (Liberale) - The passage specifically states that \"Liberal criticism of the reconstruction process focused on reconstruction contracts being awarded to supposed Washington insiders\"\n3. Bush - He is not mentioned as criticizing anything\n4. Washington insiders - They are mentioned as recipients of contracts, not as critics\n\n**Key distinction:**\nWhile fiscal conservatives criticized the overall spending, the question specifically asks about criticism of the reconstruction **contracts**. The passage clearly states that liberal criticism focused specifically on how reconstruction contracts were awarded to Washington insiders.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses Tibetan Buddhism, explaining that it is based on Buddha's teachings but has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and numerous Indian yoga techniques. It states that Tibetan Buddhism consists of three main components: Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.\n\n**Key information about meditation:**\nThe passage specifically states: \"Im Zentrum der tibetischen Meditation steht das Götter-Yoga. Durch die Visualisierung verschiedener Gottheiten werden die Energiekanäle gereinigt, die Chakren geöffnet und das erleuchtete Bewusstsein entsteht.\"\n\nTranslation: \"At the center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.\"\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the passage, how are the chakras opened in the 'center' of Tibetan meditation?\"\n\n**Examining the options:**\n1. Through various yoga poses - This is mentioned for Kundalini yoga, not specifically for the center of Tibetan meditation\n2. Visualization of deities - This directly matches what the passage states about the center of Tibetan meditation\n3. Repetition of mantras - This is mentioned for Kundalini yoga, not the center of meditation\n4. Breathing exercises - This is also mentioned for Kundalini yoga, not the center of meditation\n\nThe passage clearly states that deity yoga (Götter-Yoga) is at the center of Tibetan meditation, and that through visualization of various deities, the chakras are opened.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses traffic flow, which is defined as the study of movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions. It mentions that studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty. However, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently, so traffic flows have certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the key information**\nThe passage states that to better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main properties have been defined:\n1. Flow (Fluss)\n2. Density (Dichte) \n3. Speed/Velocity (Geschwindigkeit)\n\nThese relationships help with planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following possibilities is used to mathematically represent traffic flow?\"\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n1. Straßenbetrieb (Road operation) - This is mentioned as something that benefits from the mathematical representation, not as a component of it\n2. Fahrerverhalten (Driver behavior) - This is mentioned as unpredictable and difficult to study, not as a mathematical tool\n3. Straßendesign (Road design) - This is mentioned as benefiting from the relationships, not as a component of the mathematical representation\n4. Verkehrsdichte (Traffic density) - This corresponds to \"Dichte\" (density), which is explicitly listed as one of the three main properties used to mathematically represent traffic flow\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly states that density (Dichte) is one of the three main properties used to mathematically represent traffic flow. \"Verkehrsdichte\" (traffic density) directly corresponds to this concept.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses theories about the origins of Sanskrit. It mentions:\n- One theory about Aryan migration from the west to India, bringing their language\n- Sanskrit is an ancient language comparable to Latin in Europe\n- The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit\n- After the collection of the Upanishads, Sanskrit retreated for hierarchical reasons\n- Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that served as a source for many modern Indian languages, similar to how Latin was the origin of European languages like French and Spanish\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"For what reason did Sanskrit retreat according to the passage?\"\n\n**Examining the key sentence:**\nThe crucial sentence is: \"Nach der Sammlung der Upanishaden wich das Sanskrit aus hierarchischen Gründen zurück.\"\nTranslation: \"After the collection of the Upanishads, Sanskrit retreated for hierarchical reasons.\"\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n1. Komplexität (Complexity) - Not mentioned as a reason for retreat\n2. Arische Migration (Aryan Migration) - This is mentioned as an origin theory, not a reason for retreat\n3. Lateinische Sprachen (Latin languages) - Latin is mentioned for comparison only, not as a cause of Sanskrit's retreat\n4. Hierarchie (Hierarchy) - This directly matches \"hierarchischen Gründen\" (hierarchical reasons) mentioned in the passage\n\nThe passage explicitly states that Sanskrit retreated \"aus hierarchischen Gründen\" (for hierarchical reasons).\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses ancient China's method of marking different eras through dynasties. It explains that each time period and ruling family constituted its own dynasty, with unstable periods of divided provinces between dynasties.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the key information**\nThe passage specifically mentions:\n- The most famous of these transitional periods was the \"Epoch of the Three Kingdoms\" (Epoche der Drei Königreiche)\n- This period lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties\n- During this time, bitter wars raged among nobles fighting for the throne\n- The passage explicitly states: \"Die Zeit der drei Königreiche war eine der blutigsten Epochen in der Geschichte des alten China\" (The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China)\n- Thousands of people died fighting for the highest throne\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following epochs was, according to the passage, one of the bloodiest in China?\"\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n1. Die Jin-Dynastie (The Jin Dynasty) - This is mentioned as coming after the Three Kingdoms period, but not described as bloody\n2. Die Xi'an-Ära (The Xi'an Era) - Xi'an is mentioned only as the location of the great palace, not as a bloody era\n3. Die Han-Dynastie (The Han Dynasty) - This is mentioned as coming before the Three Kingdoms period, but not described as bloody\n4. Die Zeit der Drei Reiche (The Time of the Three Kingdoms) - This is explicitly stated in the passage as \"one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China\"\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly and directly states that the Time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in ancient Chinese history.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses the domestication and use of goats in ancient times. It states that goats were domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran. Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and hide. Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures, supervised by goat herders (similar to shepherds), often children or adolescents.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"What was NOT a reason why goats were kept in ancient cultures?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"Versorgung mit Fleisch\" (Supply of meat) - The passage explicitly mentions \"Fleisch\" (meat) as one of the reasons goats were kept.\n\n2. \"Hilfe beim Weiden des Landes\" (Help with grazing the land) - This is not mentioned in the passage as a reason for keeping goats. The passage only mentions that goats grazed on hills and pastures, but doesn't suggest they were kept to help with land management.\n\n3. \"Sie boten Gesellschaft\" (They provided companionship) - This is not mentioned in the passage as a reason for keeping goats.\n\n4. \"Versorgung mit Milch\" (Supply of milk) - The passage explicitly mentions \"Milch\" (milk) as one of the reasons goats were kept.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe passage specifically states that ancient cultures kept goats \"um leicht an deren Milch, Fell, Fleisch und Haut zu kommen\" (to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and hide). Options 1 and 4 are directly mentioned as reasons. Option 3 (companionship) and option 2 (help with land grazing) are not mentioned as reasons. However, option 2 seems more plausible as an incorrect reason since the passage focuses on material benefits rather than companionship.\n\nLooking more carefully, option 3 (companionship) is clearly not mentioned and seems least likely as a practical reason in ancient cultures focused on survival needs.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses \"reverse culture shock\" (Rückkehrschock) - the phenomenon that occurs when people return home after living abroad. Key points:\n- Reverse culture shock comes earlier than regular culture shock\n- It lasts longer and can be more severe\n- People who adapted easily to a new culture often have particular difficulty readjusting to their home culture\n- When returning home, people have adapted to another culture and abandoned some behaviors from their home culture\n- People expect patience and understanding for travelers going abroad, but may not expect the same patience is needed for returning travelers\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"What do travelers with reverse culture shock find difficult?\" (Was fällt Reisenden mit einem Rückkehrschock schwer?)\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. \"Adapting to the culture of a new place\" - This would be regular culture shock, not reverse culture shock\n2. \"Being patient and understanding\" - This is not mentioned as something travelers struggle with\n3. \"Traveling abroad\" - This is not mentioned as a difficulty\n4. \"Readjusting to their home culture\" - This directly matches what the passage describes as the main challenge of reverse culture shock\n\n**Step 4: Finding the answer**\nThe passage clearly states that travelers who return home have difficulty readjusting because they \"have adapted to another culture and abandoned some behaviors from their home culture.\" The text specifically mentions that those who adapted easily abroad \"find it particularly difficult to readjust to their home culture.\"\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage explains how atomic bombs work based on nuclear principles. It states:\n- Energy is needed to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons\n- This is compared to rolling a heavy wagon up a hill (requiring energy input)\n- When the nucleus is split again, part of this energy is released\n- Some atoms have unstable nuclei that decay with little or no external trigger\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the passage, what happens when an atomic nucleus is split?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. \"Protonen werden gewonnen\" (Protons are gained) - The passage doesn't mention gaining protons during nuclear splitting\n2. \"Energie wird freigesetzt\" (Energy is released) - The passage explicitly states \"Wird der Kern wieder gespalten, wird ein Teil dieser Energie freigesetzt\" (When the nucleus is split again, part of this energy is released)\n3. \"Atome werden instabil\" (Atoms become unstable) - The passage mentions that some atoms already have unstable nuclei, but doesn't say splitting makes atoms unstable\n4. \"Neutronen gehen verloren\" (Neutrons are lost) - The passage doesn't specifically mention losing neutrons during splitting\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe passage clearly and directly states that when a nucleus is split, energy is released. This is the main point being explained about how atomic bombs work.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage describes heritage hotels that date back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, before WWII, in the 19th or early 20th century. These hotels used to host the rich and famous of their time, who enjoyed good food and nightlife there. The passage mentions that antique furnishings, the absence of modern conveniences, and a certain elegant age characterize these hotels. Although usually privately owned, they sometimes host heads of state and other dignitaries. Very wealthy travelers might choose round-the-world flights combined with visits to many of these hotels.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"Which offerings are LEAST emphasized for hotel guests according to the information in the passage?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. Antique furnishings in the house - This is explicitly mentioned as part of their character\n2. A restaurant with an excellent chef - The passage mentions \"good food\" (gutes Essen) that guests enjoyed\n3. A lounge with evening entertainment - The passage mentions \"nightlife\" (Nachtleben) that guests enjoyed\n4. Affordable room prices - This is NOT mentioned anywhere in the passage\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe passage emphasizes the historical character (antique furnishings), good food, and nightlife as key features of these heritage hotels. It also mentions that very wealthy travelers visit these places and that they host heads of state, which suggests these are expensive, luxury establishments rather than budget accommodations. Affordable room prices are completely absent from the discussion and would contradict the luxury nature described.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll translate the passage to understand it:\n   \"The 28-year-old Vidal had come to Barça from Sevilla three seasons ago. Since his move to the Catalonian capital, Vidal had played 49 matches for the club.\"\n\n2. Now I'll translate the question:\n   \"How many matches has Vidal played for Barça?\"\n\n3. Looking at the passage, it clearly states: \"Vidal hatte für den Verein 49 Partien gespielt\" which means \"Vidal had played 49 matches for the club.\"\n\n4. The question asks specifically about how many matches (Partien) Vidal played for Barça, and the passage directly provides this information.\n\n5. Checking the options:\n   - Option 1: 49 ✓ (matches the information in the passage)\n   - Option 2: 39 (not mentioned)\n   - Option 3: 3 (this refers to seasons, not matches)\n   - Option 4: 29 (not mentioned)\n\nThe passage explicitly states that Vidal played 49 matches for Barcelona.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about Timbuktu and provides several facts about the city:\n\n1. Due to its combination with relative inaccessibility, \"Timbuktu\" has become a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.\n\n2. Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, it is nowadays an impoverished city.\n\n3. In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat from desert sand.\n\n4. It was one of the important stations in Louis Gates' PBS special \"Wonders of the African World.\"\n\n5. The city stands in strong contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic rather than African flair.\n\nNow let me examine each option to see which description does NOT apply to Timbuktu:\n\nOption 1: \"The city has more of an Arabic flair than the rest of the country\" - This IS true according to the passage, which states the city has \"eher ein arabisches als ein afrikanisches Flair\" (more Arabic than African flair).\n\nOption 2: \"The city is impoverished\" - This IS true according to the passage, which states \"ist es heutzutage eine verarmte Stadt\" (it is nowadays an impoverished city).\n\nOption 3: \"The city is not reachable by airplane\" - This is NOT true according to the passage, which explicitly states \"einen Flughafen besitzt\" (possesses an airport).\n\nOption 4: \"The city is still an attraction for curious tourists\" - This IS true according to the passage, which states it \"als Touristenattraktion gilt\" (is considered a tourist attraction).\n\nThe question asks which description does NOT apply to Timbuktu. Option 3 is incorrect because the passage clearly states that Timbuktu has an airport, meaning it IS reachable by airplane.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses bus transportation from an inter-district bus station. Key points:\n- Buses run all day from the inter-district bus station (across the river)\n- Most buses, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM\n- Since inter-district buses are often full, it's recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance\n- Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses that are comfortable and stable\n- Shared taxis offer a quick and convenient way to reach nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200)\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"Which situation would be ideal for travelers who want to take a bus from the inter-district bus station according to the passage?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\n1. \"Travelers going to Jakar who have already bought a ticket\"\n   - This is ideal because: Jakar buses depart in the prime time (6:30-7:30), and having a pre-purchased ticket addresses the issue of buses being often full.\n\n2. \"Travelers going to Bumthang who must depart by 7 AM\"\n   - This could work since Bumthang buses run 6:30-7:30, but the 7 AM constraint is unnecessarily restrictive.\n\n3. \"Travelers going to Paro who must depart after 11 AM\"\n   - The passage mentions Paro is served by shared taxis, not buses from the inter-district station.\n\n4. \"Travelers going east who arrive at the station before 6:20 AM\"\n   - While eastbound buses depart 6:30-7:30, arriving before 6:20 doesn't guarantee anything since buses start at 6:30.\n\nThe ideal situation combines the key recommendations from the passage: traveling to a destination well-served by the inter-district buses (Jakar) and having advance tickets to deal with the crowding issue.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses Charles's educational path, contrasting it with tradition. It states:\n- Traditionally, the heir to the throne went directly to the military after finishing school\n- However, Charles studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, at Trinity College in Cambridge\n- He graduated with a 2:2 degree (a degree without special distinction)\n- Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a university degree\n\n**Understanding the question:**\n\"Was erreichte Charles dem Abschnitt zufolge als Erster?\" translates to \"What did Charles achieve as the first, according to the passage?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"Vor Abschluss der Schule zum Militär zu gehen\" = \"To go to the military before finishing school\" - This is incorrect; the passage says this was the traditional path, not something Charles did first.\n\n2. \"Archäologie zu studieren\" = \"To study archaeology\" - The passage mentions he studied archaeology, but doesn't say he was the first to do so.\n\n3. \"Einen Hochschulabschluss\" = \"A university degree\" - The passage explicitly states \"Charles war das erste Mitglied der britischen Königsfamilie, dem ein Hochschulabschluss verliehen wurde\" (Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a university degree).\n\n4. \"Besuch des Trinity College\" = \"Attending Trinity College\" - The passage mentions he attended Trinity College but doesn't say he was the first to do so.\n\nThe passage clearly states that Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a university degree.\n\n3",

The vehicle was removed from the accident scene around 12:00 GMT the same day\n4. A person working in a nearby workshop said there were children waiting to cross the street who screamed and cried, then ran away from the accident scene\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks \"Wer wurde bei dem Unfall verletzt?\" which means \"Who was injured in the accident?\"\n\n**Examining each option:**\n1. Gibson - The passage states he was taken to the hospital and died shortly after, indicating he was injured\n2. Ein Werkstattmitarbeiter (A workshop worker) - Only mentioned as a witness, no indication of injury\n3. Kinder (Children) - They were waiting to cross the street and ran away crying, but no mention of them being injured\n4. Ein LKW-Fahrer (A truck driver) - The passage explicitly states \"wurde bei dem Unfall nicht verletzt\" (was not injured in the accident)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGibson is the only person explicitly described as being injured (taken to hospital and died from the accident). The truck driver is specifically stated as not being injured, and there's no mention of the children or workshop worker being hurt.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what the passage is about:\nThe passage discusses sanctions against Iran and their economic impact, particularly on oil exports.\n\n2. Now I'll examine the specific question:\nThe question asks: \"Who, according to the passage, admitted that the sanctions are having an effect on the Iranian economy?\"\n\n3. Let me look at the key sentence in the passage:\n\"Mit den Kommentaren, die live im Fernsehen abgegeben wurden, gaben hochrangige iranische Quellen zum ersten Mal zu, dass die Sanktionen Wirkung zeigen.\"\n\nThis translates to: \"With the comments that were made live on television, high-ranking Iranian sources admitted for the first time that the sanctions are showing effect.\"\n\n4. Let me check what each option refers to in the passage:\n- Option 1: \"Hochrangige Quellen\" (High-ranking sources) - This matches exactly with \"hochrangige iranische Quellen\" who admitted the sanctions are working\n- Option 2: \"OPEC\" - The passage mentions OPEC reported on oil export levels, but doesn't say they admitted sanctions are working\n- Option 3: \"Ayatollah Ali Chamenei\" - He described oil dependency as a \"trap\" but didn't admit sanctions are working\n- Option 4: \"Die Europäische Union\" (The European Union) - They imposed the sanctions but didn't admit they're working\n\n5. The answer is clearly stated in the first sentence: high-ranking Iranian sources admitted that the sanctions are showing effect.\n\n1",

This was the first time that a conviction was achieved using 2003 legislation aimed at curbing mass delivery of unwanted emails to users' inboxes, also known as spam.\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n1. \"Er wurde in dem Bundesstaat verfolgt, in dem AOL seinen Sitz hat\" (It was prosecuted in the state where AOL has its headquarters)\n   - This is TRUE according to the passage - it was prosecuted in Virginia because AOL has its headquarters there.\n\n2. \"Es kam zu einem Schuldspruch\" (There was a conviction)\n   - This is TRUE - the passage explicitly states \"ein Schuldspruch erreicht werden konnte\" (a conviction could be achieved).\n\n3. \"Es wurde in diesem Fall die Gesetzgebung zu Spam-E-Mails genutzt\" (The legislation regarding spam emails was used in this case)\n   - This is TRUE - the passage mentions the 2003 legislation against spam was applied.\n\n4. \"AOL wurde angeklagt\" (AOL was charged/indicted)\n   - This is FALSE - the passage states that AOL is \"die Firma, die die Klage auf den Weg gebracht hat\" (the company that initiated the lawsuit), meaning AOL was the plaintiff, not the defendant.\n\nThe question asks which statement does NOT apply to the case.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses scientific work that was largely theoretical in nature, but a program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy. The key points are:\n\n1. Scientists were looking for a specific effect\n2. This effect would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way\n3. Just like the Moon attracts Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy\n4. Scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter\n5. The theory states that most dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles\n\n**Understanding the question:**\n\"Wissenschaftler, die an dem Programm arbeiten, hoffen Effekte wovon zu finden?\"\nTranslation: \"Scientists working on the program hope to find effects of what?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. Normale Materie (Normal matter)\n2. Gezeiten (Tides)\n3. Kleine Partikel (Small particles)\n4. Dunkle Materie (Dark matter)\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe passage clearly states that \"Der Effekt, nach dem das Team suchte, würde von Gezeitenkräften zwischen der dunklen Materie der Galaxie und der dunklen Materie der Milchstraße verursacht werden\" (The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way).\n\nThe scientists are specifically studying the effects of dark matter interactions - how dark matter from one galaxy affects dark matter from another galaxy through tidal forces. The entire research focus is on understanding dark matter behavior.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage describes an aircraft incident involving a Twin Otter aircraft on flight CG4684 to Kokoda (PNG - Papua New Guinea). \n\n**Key details:**\n1. The Twin Otter attempted to land in Kokoda yesterday but failed\n2. About ten minutes before it was supposed to land on its second approach attempt, it disappeared\n3. The crash site was found today but is so inaccessible that two police officers had to be dropped in the jungle to reach the accident site and search for survivors\n4. The search is being hindered by the same bad weather conditions that also led to the failed landing\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"Why did flight CG4684 have to abort the landing?\" (Wodurch musste Flug CG4684 die Landung abbrechen?)\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n1. \"The landing site was inaccessible\" - This refers to the crash site being inaccessible for rescue teams, not the reason for the landing abort\n2. \"Several other aircraft were ahead of CG4684\" - No mention of other aircraft in the passage\n3. \"The aircraft was diverted to Kokoda\" - The passage indicates Kokoda was the intended destination, not a diversion\n4. \"The weather conditions were bad\" - The passage explicitly states that the search is hindered by \"the same bad weather conditions that also led to the failed landing\"\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that bad weather conditions caused the failed landing attempt.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage describes heritage hotels that date back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, before WWII, in the 19th or early 20th century. Key characteristics mentioned:\n- Rich and famous people used to stay there\n- They enjoyed good food and nightlife\n- These hotels have antique furnishings\n- They lack modern conveniences \n- They have a certain elegant aged quality\n- They sometimes host heads of state and dignitaries\n- Very wealthy travelers might choose world tours that include stays at many such hotels\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"What would you probably NOT find in the hotels described in the passage?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\n1. **A cocktail bar** - The passage mentions that rich and famous people enjoyed \"nightlife\" at these hotels, so a cocktail bar would be likely.\n\n2. **A gourmet restaurant on-site** - The passage specifically mentions that guests enjoyed \"good food\" at these hotels, so this would be expected.\n\n3. **Famous or well-known other guests** - The passage states that \"rich and famous people used to stay\" there and that they \"sometimes host heads of state and dignitaries,\" so famous guests would be likely.\n\n4. **Newly renovated rooms with modern amenities** - The passage explicitly states these hotels have \"antique furnishings\" and \"the absence of modern conveniences\" as part of their character. This directly contradicts newly renovated rooms with modern amenities.\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that the lack of modern conveniences is a defining characteristic of these heritage hotels.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage describes a hostage situation in Manila where a former Philippine police officer named Rolando Mendoza hijacked a bus with tourists from Hong Kong. He shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.\n\nNow, let me identify who was released early according to the passage:\n\nThe key sentence states: \"Sechs Geiseln, darunter die Kinder und Ältere, wurden, wie auch die philippinischen Fotografen, frühzeitig freigelassen.\"\n\nThis translates to: \"Six hostages, including the children and elderly, were released early, as were the Philippine photographers.\"\n\nSo according to the passage, those who WERE released early include:\n- Children (die Kinder)\n- Elderly people (die Ältere) \n- Philippine photographers (die philippinischen Fotografen)\n\nThe question asks which hostages were NOT released early according to the passage.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Die Touristen (The tourists) - The passage mentions tourists from Hong Kong were taken hostage, but doesn't specifically say all tourists were released early\n2. Die Älteren (The elderly) - These WERE released early according to the passage\n3. Die Fotografen (The photographers) - These WERE released early according to the passage  \n4. Die Kinder (The children) - These WERE released early according to the passage\n\nSince the elderly, photographers, and children were all specifically mentioned as being released early, but the tourists as a whole group were not said to be released early (only some specific categories among them), the answer is the tourists.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage describes events in June 1956 when Khrushchev's promises were tested. It mentions riots in Poland where workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, which developed into a general protest against communism. The passage states that although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Władysław Gomułka as the new Prime Minister.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following statements, according to the passage, was NOT part of Khrushchev's reaction to the worker riots?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. \"Appointment of a new Prime Minister\" - The passage explicitly states that Khrushchev agreed to appoint Władysław Gomułka as the new Prime Minister. This WAS part of his reaction.\n\n2. \"Use of tanks to restore order\" - The passage clearly mentions that Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order. This WAS part of his reaction.\n\n3. \"Further wage cuts\" - The passage mentions that workers were protesting AGAINST wage cuts, and that Khrushchev gave in to some economic demands. There is no mention of him implementing further wage cuts as a response. This was NOT part of his reaction.\n\n4. \"Acknowledging some of the economic demands\" - The passage explicitly states that he gave in to some economic demands. This WAS part of his reaction.\n\nThe question asks for what was NOT part of Khrushchev's reaction. Only option 3 (further wage cuts) is not mentioned as part of his response.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about Luxembourg's history. Let me break down the key information:\n\n1. Luxembourg has a long history but has only been independent since 1839\n2. Parts of present-day Belgium used to belong to Luxembourg in the past\n3. These parts became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s\n4. Although Luxembourg tried to remain neutral, it was occupied by Germany in both World Wars\n5. Luxembourg became a founding member in 1957 of what is now known as the European Union\n\nThe question asks: \"After which event did parts of Luxembourg go to Belgium?\"\n\nLooking at the passage, it clearly states that parts of present-day Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but \"wurden jedoch nach der Belgischen Revolution in den 1830ern Teil Belgiens\" - which means \"however became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s.\"\n\nSo the passage directly states that parts of Luxembourg went to Belgium after the Belgian Revolution (Belgische Revolution) in the 1830s.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. First World War - not mentioned as causing territorial changes\n2. Belgian Revolution - this is explicitly mentioned as the event after which parts went to Belgium\n3. Second World War - not mentioned as causing territorial changes\n4. Founding of the European Union - this happened in 1957, much later\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step to understand what advantages of booking through a travel agency are mentioned, and then identify what is NOT mentioned as an advantage.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage says about advantages of booking through a travel agency:\n\n1. The passage mentions that travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, and you can also book other accommodations like campsites through them.\n\n2. Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even flight and hotel combinations.\n\n3. They can hold your reservation if you need time to think over the offer or obtain additional documents for your destination (like visas).\n\n4. Any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.\n\nNow let me examine each option to see which one is NOT mentioned as an advantage:\n\n1. \"Beschleunigte Reisedokumente\" (Accelerated travel documents) - The passage mentions that agencies can hold reservations while you obtain documents like visas, but it does NOT say they accelerate or speed up the process of getting travel documents.\n\n2. \"Hotelangebote\" (Hotel offers) - This IS mentioned as the passage talks about agencies having agreements with specific hotels.\n\n3. \"All-inclusive-Pakete\" (All-inclusive packages) - This IS mentioned as the passage describes packages including breakfast, transport, flight and hotel combinations.\n\n4. \"Zurückhalten einer Reservierung\" (Holding a reservation) - This IS explicitly mentioned as an advantage.\n\nThe passage does not mention that travel agencies provide accelerated or expedited travel documents as an advantage.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\n\nThe passage discusses research from the 20th century showing there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden (versteckt) and expressed (exprimiert). It then explains what different processes do:\n\n1. \"Mutation sorgt für neue genetische Variationen\" - Mutation provides/creates new genetic variations\n2. \"Selektion entfernt diese aus dem Pool exprimierter Variationen\" - Selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations\n3. \"Segregation und Rekombination mischen die Variation zwischen den beiden Pools\" - Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools\n\nNow for the question: \"Welcher Prozess ist für das Hinzufügen genetischer Variation verantwortlich?\" \nThis translates to: \"Which process is responsible for adding genetic variation?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Segregation - The passage says this mixes variation between pools, not adds new variation\n2. Rekombination (Recombination) - The passage says this also mixes variation between pools, not adds new variation\n3. Mutation - The passage explicitly states \"Mutation sorgt für neue genetische Variationen\" (mutation provides new genetic variations)\n4. Exprimiert (Expressed) - This is not a process, but rather describes one type of variation pool\n\nThe passage clearly states that mutation is responsible for providing new genetic variations.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage explains what \"scaffolding\" is in learning contexts:\n\n1. Scaffolding is not a learning method itself, but rather a form of assistance that supports individuals in novel learning situations\n2. Examples given include: using a new computer program or starting a new project\n3. Scaffolds can be both virtual and real\n4. A teacher is a form of scaffold, as is the small paperclip character in Microsoft Office\n5. Virtual assistance is built into software and is meant to question, suggest, and explain work steps that a student might not be able to handle alone\n\nThe key characteristics of scaffolding from the passage:\n- Provides support/assistance in new learning situations\n- Can be virtual or real\n- Helps with tasks the learner cannot complete independently\n- Guides, suggests, and explains\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game - This provides guidance in a new situation (learning the game), fits the definition of scaffolding\n2. A SAT tutor - This is a person providing support/guidance to help students with tasks they cannot handle alone, similar to the teacher example given\n3. An independent learning program - This is designed for learners to work through on their own without additional support or guidance\n4. A trainer for a small league - This is a person providing guidance and support, similar to a teacher\n\nThe question asks which is NOT a scaffold according to the passage. An independent learning program would be designed for autonomous use without the supportive guidance that characterizes scaffolding.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses a PBS show that won more than two dozen Emmy awards and had a runtime only shorter than Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Each episode focused on a theme from a specific book and explored that theme through multiple stories. The show also gave book recommendations for children to look for when visiting their library.\n\nJohn Grant from WNED Buffalo (Reading Rainbow's home station) said that \"Reading Rainbow taught children why they should read... the love of reading - [the show] encouraged children to pick up a book and read.\"\n\nThe key sentence for answering the question is the last one: \"Some people, including John Grant, believe that both the funding crisis and a change in educational television philosophy contributed to the end of the series.\"\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"What probably led to the end of the Reading Rainbow show?\"\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n1. Insufficient funding (Unzureichende Finanzierung) - This matches \"Finanzierungskrise\" (funding crisis) mentioned in the passage\n2. Too few Emmy awards - The passage states the show won MORE than two dozen Emmys, so this contradicts the text\n3. John Grant's opinion - John Grant actually praised the show and explained its positive impact\n4. The success of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood - This is not mentioned as a cause for the end\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe passage explicitly states that a \"funding crisis\" (Finanzierungskrise) was one of the factors that contributed to the end of the series, which directly corresponds to option 1 \"insufficient funding.\"\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses nutrition for young athletes. It states that:\n- Good nutrition alone does not guarantee top performance (\"Gute Ernährung allein garantiert keine Topleistungen\")\n- However, it significantly improves the general well-being of young athletes\n- Maintaining healthy energy balance, effective drinking habits, and understanding supplements can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sports\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following points cannot be achieved by an athlete through nutrition alone?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. Improved performance (Verbesserte Leistung) - The passage suggests nutrition can help improve performance\n2. Increased enjoyment of sports (Gesteigerte Freude am Sport) - The passage indicates nutrition can help increase enjoyment of sports\n3. Top performance (Spitzenleistung) - The passage explicitly states that \"good nutrition alone does not guarantee top performance\"\n4. General well-being (Allgemeines Wohlbefinden) - The passage clearly states that nutrition significantly improves general well-being\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe passage directly states that good nutrition alone does not guarantee top performance (\"Topleistungen\"), while it indicates that nutrition can contribute to improved performance, increased sport enjoyment, and general well-being.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage is about: It describes the Mumbai attacks that occurred on November 26, 2008.\n\n2. Now I'll look for information about transportation methods mentioned in the passage:\n   - The passage states \"Die Angreifer von Mumbai kamen am 26. November 2008 mit Hilfe von Booten\" which translates to \"The Mumbai attackers came on November 26, 2008 with the help of boats\"\n\n3. The question asks: \"Mit welchem Transportmittel kam die militante Gruppe nach Mumbai?\" which means \"By what means of transportation did the militant group come to Mumbai?\"\n\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: Eisenbahn (Railway/Train)\n   - Option 2: Flugzeug (Airplane)\n   - Option 3: Boot (Boat)\n   - Option 4: Auto (Car)\n\n5. The passage clearly states that the attackers came \"mit Hilfe von Booten\" (with the help of boats), which directly corresponds to option 3 \"Boot.\"\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage describes a situation of extensive looting that lasted through the night in Bishkek, with no police presence on the streets. It mentions that Bishkek was falling into a state of \"anarchy\" as gangs of people moved through the streets looting consumer goods stores. The final sentence states that several residents of Bishkek blamed the southern demonstrators for the lawlessness.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"Who made the southern demonstrators responsible for the looting?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. Einwohner von Bischkek (Residents of Bishkek)\n2. Polizeibeamte (Police officers)\n3. Anarchisten (Anarchists)\n4. Banden von Menschen (Gangs of people)\n\n**Finding the answer:**\nThe key sentence is: \"Mehrere Einwohner von Bishkek gaben den Demonstranten aus dem Süden die Schuld an der Gesetzlosigkeit.\"\n\nThis translates to: \"Several residents of Bishkek blamed the southern demonstrators for the lawlessness.\"\n\nThe passage clearly states that it was the residents of Bishkek who blamed the southern demonstrators for the lawlessness/looting.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage is about:\n   - It discusses a story presented in a French opera by Camille Saint-Saens\n   - The story is about an artist whose life is determined by love for drugs and Japan\n   - Because of this theme, the performers on stage smoke cannabis joints\n   - The theater encourages the audience to participate\n\n2. Now I'll examine the question:\n   - \"Wer raucht als erstes Joints während der Oper?\" means \"Who smokes joints first during the opera?\"\n\n3. Looking at the passage for the sequence of events:\n   - The passage states \"Deshalb rauchen die Darsteller auf der Bühne Cannabisjoints\" (Therefore the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage)\n   - Then it says \"und das Theater selbst ermutigt das Publikum zum Mitmachen\" (and the theater itself encourages the audience to participate)\n\n4. The word \"Deshalb\" (therefore) indicates that the performers smoke because of the story's theme, and this happens before the audience is encouraged to participate.\n\n5. Analyzing the options:\n   - Option 1: \"Der Künstler\" (The artist) - This refers to the character in the story, not who actually smokes\n   - Option 2: \"Das französische Publikum\" (The French audience) - They are encouraged to participate after\n   - Option 3: \"Die Darsteller\" (The performers) - They smoke on stage first\n   - Option 4: \"Camille Saint-Saens\" - This is the composer, not mentioned as smoking\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that the performers (die Darsteller) smoke first on stage, and then the audience is encouraged to join in.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses how children develop racial awareness and racial stereotypes early, and how these stereotypes affect behavior. It provides a specific example: children who identify with an ethnic minority that is said to perform poorly in school tend to perform poorly in school once they become aware of the stereotype associated with their ethnicity.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: According to the theory presented in the passage, what could happen to a child who identifies with a racial minority that is stereotyped for threatening behavior?\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the pattern from the passage**\nThe passage establishes a clear pattern: when children become aware of negative stereotypes associated with their ethnic group, they tend to conform to those stereotypes. The example shows that children from groups stereotyped as poor academic performers actually perform poorly once they learn about this stereotype.\n\n**Step 4: Applying this pattern to the question**\nFollowing the same logic, if a child identifies with a racial minority that is stereotyped for threatening behavior, and the child becomes aware of this stereotype, the theory suggests the child would be more likely to exhibit that stereotyped behavior (threatening behavior).\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the options**\n1. The child will try to avoid threatening behavior - This contradicts the pattern shown in the passage\n2. The child will be more inclined toward threatening behavior - This follows the pattern established in the passage\n3. The child will withdraw from social situations - This is not supported by the passage's logic\n4. The child refuses to interact with other racial minorities - This is unrelated to the pattern described\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that children tend to conform to the negative stereotypes associated with their group once they become aware of them.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what the passage is about:\nThe passage discusses the results of a primary election, mentioning several political candidates including Newt Gingrich (former Speaker of the House), Rick Perry (Texas Governor), and Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who placed fourth, fifth, and sixth respectively.\n\nNow I'll look for who praised another candidate after the results were announced:\n\nThe key sentence is: \"Nachdem die Ergebnisse vorlagen, lobte Gingrich Santorum, fand aber harte Worte für Romney...\"\n\nThis translates to: \"After the results were available, Gingrich praised Santorum, but found harsh words for Romney...\"\n\nSo the passage clearly states that Gingrich (Gingrich) praised (lobte) Santorum after the primary results came in.\n\nLooking at the other candidates mentioned:\n- Perry talked about returning to Texas to evaluate the results and decide whether to continue\n- Bachmann decided to end her campaign\n- Romney is mentioned as the target of Gingrich's criticism, not as someone who praised others\n\nThe question asks: \"Who, according to the passage, praised another candidate after the primary results were available?\"\n\nThe answer is clearly Gingrich, who praised Santorum.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses what traditionally happened to heirs to the throne versus what Charles did differently. It states:\n\n- Traditionally (\"Traditionell\"), the heir to the throne went directly to the military after finishing school\n- However, Charles studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, at Trinity College Cambridge\n- He graduated with a 2:2 degree (a degree without special distinction)\n- Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a university degree\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the passage, what is typical for an heir to the throne?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"University degree with 2:2\" - This was specific to Charles, not typical for heirs\n2. \"Going to the military instead of university\" - This matches what the passage says was traditional: going directly to military after school\n3. \"Studying history\" - This was what Charles did, not what was typical\n4. \"First university, then military\" - This describes Charles's path, not the traditional path\n\n**Key insight:**\nThe passage explicitly contrasts traditional behavior (\"Traditionell ging der Thronerbe...direkt zum Militär\") with what Charles did differently (\"Charles studierte jedoch danach...\"). The word \"jedoch\" (however) indicates Charles broke from tradition.\n\nThe traditional pattern was: school → directly to military\nCharles's pattern was: school → university → (presumably military later)\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about algal blooms caused by Karenia brevis. Let me identify what the passage tells us about Karenia brevis:\n\n1. It causes algal blooms when present in higher than usual concentrations\n2. It is described as \"einem natürlich auftretenden Meereseinzeller\" - a naturally occurring marine single-celled organism\n3. It produces a neurotoxin that can deactivate nerves in both humans and fish\n4. The toxin kills fish due to high concentrations in the water\n5. Humans can be affected by inhaling affected water that gets into the air through wind and waves\n\nNow let me check each option against what the passage states:\n\nOption 1: \"Ist eine Algenart\" (Is a type of algae) - The passage refers to \"Algenblüte\" (algal bloom) caused by Karenia brevis, so this is TRUE.\n\nOption 2: \"Kann die Nerven beim Menschen deaktivieren\" (Can deactivate nerves in humans) - The passage explicitly states the algae produce a neurotoxin \"das Nerven sowohl beim Menschen als auch bei Fischen deaktivieren kann\" (that can deactivate nerves in both humans and fish). This is TRUE.\n\nOption 3: \"Ist ein Mehrzeller\" (Is multicellular) - The passage specifically describes Karenia brevis as \"einem natürlich auftretenden Meereseinzeller\" (a naturally occurring marine single-celled organism). \"Einzeller\" means single-celled, which contradicts \"Mehrzeller\" (multicellular). This is FALSE.\n\nOption 4: \"Tritt natürlich auf\" (Occurs naturally) - The passage describes it as \"natürlich auftretenden\" (naturally occurring). This is TRUE.\n\nThe question asks what is NOT a property of Karenia brevis. Option 3 is the only false statement.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\n\nThe passage discusses estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It mentions that Hindi is estimated to be the 2nd to 4th most spoken language in the world. Then it specifically addresses what affects the count of native speakers.\n\nThe key sentence is: \"Die Anzahl der Muttersprachler variiert abhängig davon, ob sehr eng verwandte Dialekte mitgezählt werden oder nicht.\"\n\nThis translates to: \"The number of native speakers varies depending on whether very closely related dialects are counted or not.\"\n\nThe passage then gives estimates ranging from 340 to 500 million speakers, and mentions that up to 800 million people understand the language. It also discusses the relationship between Hindi and Urdu.\n\nNow looking at the question: \"Welcher Faktor beeinflusst dem Abschnitt zufolge die Fluktuationen der Anzahl der Hindi-Muttersprachler?\"\n\nThis asks: \"Which factor influences the fluctuations in the number of Hindi native speakers according to the passage?\"\n\nExamining the options:\n1. Whether very related dialects are counted\n2. Whether people who speak Urdu are counted\n3. Whether people who understand the language are counted\n4. Whether people who can read the language are counted\n\nThe passage explicitly states that the number of native speakers varies depending on whether closely related dialects are included in the count. This directly corresponds to option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this German passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage describes Nintendo President Satoru Iwata revealing the controller design for the new Nintendo Revolution console at the Tokyo Game Show keynote on Thursday. The controller is similar to a TV remote control and uses two sensors that are placed near the user's television to triangulate its position in three-dimensional space. This will allow players to control actions and movements in video games by moving the device in the air.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"What must a player do to control movements in video games?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"Ensure that the controller's sensors are near the console\" - This is incorrect. The passage states the sensors are placed near the TV, not the console.\n\n2. \"Triangulate the position\" - This is incorrect. The triangulation is done automatically by the system using the sensors, not by the player.\n\n3. \"Place sensors near the television\" - This is a setup requirement but not what the player does to control movements during gameplay.\n\n4. \"Move the controller in the air\" - This is correct. The passage explicitly states \"Dies wird Spielern ermöglichen Aktionen und Bewegungen in Videospielen zu steuern, indem sie das Gerät in der Luft bewegen\" (This will allow players to control actions and movements in video games by moving the device in the air).\n\nThe question specifically asks what a player must do to control movements, and according to the passage, players control game movements by moving the controller in the air.\n\n4"

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about Beijing hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics. Let me identify what will and will not take place in Beijing according to the text:\n\n**What WILL happen in Beijing:**\n- Opening and closing ceremonies (\"Pékin accueillera les cérémonies d'ouverture et de clôture\")\n- Indoor ice events (\"ainsi que les épreuves sur glace en salle\")\n\n**What will NOT happen in Beijing:**\n- Other skiing events will take place at the Taizicheng ski resort in Zhangjiakou (\"D'autres épreuves de ski se dérouleront dans la station de ski de Taizicheng à Zhangjiakou\"), which is about 220 km from Beijing.\n\nThe question asks: \"According to the excerpt, which event will NOT take place in Beijing in 2022?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Opening ceremonies - WILL take place in Beijing\n2. Events at Taizicheng ski resort - will NOT take place in Beijing (they're in Zhangjiakou)\n3. Closing ceremonies - WILL take place in Beijing  \n4. Indoor ice events - WILL take place in Beijing\n\nThe only event mentioned that will not take place in Beijing is the events at the Taizicheng ski resort, which will be held in Zhangjiakou.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses virtual teams and how they compare to conventional teams. Let me identify the key points:\n\n1. The passage states that \"virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams\" - this indicates they share the same performance expectations.\n\n2. The passage mentions that virtual team members \"often have more autonomy than traditional team members\" - this suggests autonomy is a difference, not a similarity.\n\n3. The passage describes the \"invisible team\" as \"a unique element of a virtual team\" - this indicates it's specific to virtual teams, not shared with conventional teams.\n\n4. The passage mentions that virtual teams \"can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management\" - this suggests time zone differences are a characteristic of virtual teams, not conventional ones.\n\nNow let me examine each option:\n\nOption 1: \"They are both subject to the same expectations in terms of performance\" - This directly matches what the passage states about both types of teams being subject to the same standards of excellence.\n\nOption 2: \"They both have a variable level of autonomy in their daily routine\" - The passage suggests virtual teams have MORE autonomy, indicating this is a difference, not a similarity.\n\nOption 3: \"They both report to an invisible management team\" - The passage describes the \"invisible team\" as unique to virtual teams.\n\nOption 4: \"They both function on the same time zone\" - The passage indicates virtual teams work across different time zones, which is presented as a distinguishing feature.\n\nThe correct answer is option 1, as it directly corresponds to the opening statement about both team types being subject to the same standards of excellence.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is about:\nThe passage discusses medieval castles and how they stimulate imagination, evoking images of tournaments, banquets, and Arthurian chivalry. It mentions that even among ancient ruins, one can recall sounds and smells of distant battles, hear the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, and feel fear rising from the dungeon pits.\n\nNow, let me examine what the question is asking:\nThe question asks: \"What does the excerpt NOT mention as something that could be associated with medieval castles?\"\n\nLet me check each option against what's mentioned in the passage:\n\n1. \"Les fosses des donjons\" (dungeon pits) - This IS mentioned in the passage: \"sentir la peur monter des fosses du donjon\"\n\n2. \"Les joutes\" (tournaments/jousts) - This IS mentioned in the passage: \"évoquant des images de joutes\"\n\n3. \"La chevalerie\" (chivalry) - This IS mentioned in the passage: \"chevalerie arthurienne\"\n\n4. \"Les chevaliers\" (knights) - Let me check carefully... The passage mentions \"chevalerie arthurienne\" (Arthurian chivalry), but it does not specifically mention \"chevaliers\" (knights) as individual people.\n\nThe passage talks about chivalry as a concept or system, but does not explicitly mention knights as people associated with medieval castles.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage**: The text discusses Indonesian cuisine, explaining that Indonesia has 17,000 islands and therefore Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering many regional cuisines throughout the country.\n\n2. **Focus on Javanese cuisine**: The passage specifically mentions that when \"Indonesian cuisine\" is used without qualifiers, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.\n\n3. **Key ingredients mentioned**: The text states that Javanese cuisine offers simply seasoned dishes, and lists the predominant flavors that Javanese people favor: peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.\n\n4. **Analyzing the question**: The question asks which of the following ingredients is mainly used in Javanese cuisine.\n\n5. **Examining the options**:\n   - Option 1: White sugar (Le sucre blanc)\n   - Option 2: Powdered sugar (Le sucre en poudre)\n   - Option 3: Coconut sugar (Le sucre de coco)\n   - Option 4: Brown sugar (Le sucre brun)\n\n6. **Finding the answer**: The passage explicitly mentions \"le sucre (en particulier le sucre de coco javanais)\" which translates to \"sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar).\" This directly corresponds to option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage is about:\n   - Passengers were waiting in 32°C heat\n   - They were offered water bottles\n   - Someone made a statement about the heat\n\n2. Now I'll look at who made the statement about the heat:\n   - The passage says: \"Le capitaine des pompiers Scott Kouns a déclaré\" which means \"Fire Captain Scott Kouns declared/stated\"\n\n3. What did this person say about the heat?\n   - He mentioned it was a hot day in Santa Clara County with temperatures exceeding 90°F\n   - He commented that every minute trapped on the roller coaster must be unpleasant at the very least\n   - He noted it took at least an hour to extract the first person from the ride\n\n4. The question asks: \"According to the excerpt, who made a remark about the unpleasant level of heat?\"\n\n5. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: The ride operator - not mentioned as making any statement\n   - Option 2: The fire captain - this matches \"le capitaine des pompiers\" who made the statement\n   - Option 3: The passengers - they received water but didn't make the quoted statement\n   - Option 4: The police captain - not mentioned in the passage\n\nThe fire captain (capitaine des pompiers) Scott Kouns is clearly identified as the person who made the remark about the unpleasant heat conditions.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage explains that stellar bodies emit light and heat because of energy created when hydrogen atoms fuse (or condense) to create heavier elements. Scientists are working to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way. However, this is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before successful fusion reactors are built.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the excerpt, what does fusion allow stellar bodies to do?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. \"To form heavier elements\" - This is mentioned as what happens during fusion (hydrogen atoms fuse to create heavier elements), but this is not what fusion allows stellar bodies to do as a result.\n\n2. \"To build fusion reactors\" - This is about what scientists are trying to do, not what stellar bodies do.\n\n3. \"To emit light and heat\" - The passage clearly states that stellar bodies emit light and heat \"because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms fuse.\" This is the direct result/consequence of fusion for stellar bodies.\n\n4. \"To create hydrogen atoms\" - This is incorrect; fusion uses hydrogen atoms as input, it doesn't create them.\n\nThe passage establishes a clear causal relationship: fusion creates energy, and this energy allows stellar bodies to emit light and heat.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\n\nThe passage discusses the tradition where the heir to the throne would do military service after finishing their studies. However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, obtaining a 2:2 (a lower second-class degree). The passage then states that Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a license/degree.\n\nNow let me examine the question: \"According to the information in the extract, what was Charles the first to do?\"\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n1. \"Join the army before finishing his studies\" - This is incorrect. The passage actually says he broke tradition by NOT doing military service after studies, but went to university instead.\n\n2. \"Study archaeology\" - The passage mentions he studied archaeology, but doesn't say he was the first royal to do so.\n\n3. \"Obtain a license\" - The passage explicitly states \"Charles fut le premier membre de la famille royale britannique à obtenir une licence\" (Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a degree/license).\n\n4. \"Go to Trinity College\" - The passage mentions he went there, but doesn't say he was the first royal to attend Trinity College.\n\nThe passage clearly and explicitly states that Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a university degree.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage defines as \"soutien\" (support/scaffolding):\n\n1. The passage states that support is not a learning method itself, but rather a means to help learners who are discovering new teaching, such as using a new program or starting a new project.\n\n2. Support can be both virtual and real - a teacher is a form of support, and so is Microsoft Office's paperclip assistant.\n\n3. Virtual scaffolding is integrated into software and is designed to question, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.\n\nSo support is characterized by:\n- Helping learners with NEW or unfamiliar content/procedures\n- Providing guidance, questioning, and explanation\n- Being either human or technological assistance\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. A tutorial at the beginning of a video game - This fits the definition perfectly. It helps users learn new procedures and guides them through unfamiliar content.\n\n2. A tutor for SAT exam preparation - This is clearly support, as it involves a person helping guide and explain difficult procedures to a learner.\n\n3. An independent research program - This is the key difference. An independent research program is something a student does on their own, without guidance or scaffolding. It's self-directed learning rather than supported learning.\n\n4. A local sports coach - This fits the definition as coaches guide, explain, and help learners master new skills and procedures.\n\nThe question asks which element is NOT an example of support. The independent research program stands out because it lacks the guided, scaffolded assistance that characterizes support according to the passage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The passage describes hospitality exchange networks\n   - These networks connect travelers with local residents in cities they plan to visit\n   - To join, you typically just fill out an online form (some networks may require additional verification)\n   - Members receive a list of available hosts, either printed and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers\n   - The example given is Couchsurfing, founded in 2004 by Casey Fenton, who found a cheap flight to Iceland but had no place to stay, so he emailed local university students and received many offers for free accommodation\n\n2. **Analyzing the question:**\n   The question asks: \"What is offered to travelers in hospitality exchange networks?\"\n\n3. **Evaluating each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"Accommodations with locals\" - This directly matches what the passage describes. The networks connect travelers with local residents who offer hosting/accommodation.\n   - Option 2: \"Cheap flights\" - The passage mentions Casey found a cheap flight, but this was separate from the hospitality network. The networks don't provide flights.\n   - Option 3: \"Tours conducted by local guides\" - The passage doesn't mention guided tours or tourism services.\n   - Option 4: \"Connecting with other travelers visiting the same destination\" - The passage talks about connecting travelers with LOCAL RESIDENTS, not with other travelers.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The passage clearly states that hospitality exchange networks connect travelers with local inhabitants who can host them, providing accommodation services.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The passage describes two main types of tourism\n   - **Recreational tourism (tourisme récréatif)**: When people visit places completely different from their daily environment to relax and have a good time. Examples include beaches, theme parks, and camping grounds.\n   - **Cultural tourism (tourisme culturel)**: When the objective of visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture. Tourists may visit different sites in a country or focus on a single region.\n\n2. **Analyzing the question:**\n   - The question asks: \"Visiting a museum would be considered as belonging to which category of tourism?\"\n\n3. **Evaluating the options:**\n   - Option 1: Professional tourism - Not mentioned in the passage\n   - Option 2: Recreational tourism - Focused on relaxation and fun, examples are beaches and theme parks\n   - Option 3: Cultural tourism - Focused on learning about history and culture\n   - Option 4: Exterior tourism - Not mentioned in the passage\n\n4. **Reasoning about museum visits:**\n   - Museums are primarily educational institutions where people go to learn about history, art, science, or culture\n   - The primary purpose of visiting a museum aligns with the definition of cultural tourism: \"to know the history and culture\" of a place\n   - While museum visits can be enjoyable, their main function is educational/cultural rather than purely recreational\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - A museum visit fits the definition of cultural tourism as described in the passage\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage is about \"reintegration shock\" (choc de réinsertion) that occurs when travelers return home after living abroad.\n\nKey points from the passage:\n1. Reintegration shock occurs earlier than culture shock, lasts longer, and can be more severe\n2. The honeymoon phase is shorter for reintegration shock\n3. Travelers who had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes have great difficulty readjusting to their original culture\n4. When returning home, travelers have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from their original culture\n5. People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are needed for travelers returning home\n\nThe question asks: According to the excerpt, for what type of traveler can reintegration shock be particularly difficult?\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Travelers who experienced particularly difficult culture shock\n2. Travelers who quickly adapted to life abroad\n3. Travelers still in the honeymoon period\n4. Travelers with little patience\n\nThe passage specifically states: \"Les voyageurs qui ont eu du mal à s'adapter à la nouvelle culture ont parfois beaucoup de mal à se réadapter à leur culture d'origine\" (Travelers who had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes have great difficulty readjusting to their original culture).\n\nThis directly corresponds to option 1 - travelers who experienced particularly difficult culture shock (had trouble adapting) are the ones who may find reintegration particularly difficult.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses boomerang throwing as a skill that many tourists want to acquire. It explains that if you want to learn to throw a boomerang that returns directly to your hand, you need to make sure you have a boomerang designed to return. In reality, most boomerangs available in Australia do not return. It's better for beginners not to try throwing in windy conditions.\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n1. \"Il revient toujours dans la main s'il est lancé correctement\" (It always returns to the hand if thrown correctly)\n   - This contradicts the passage, which states that most boomerangs available in Australia do not return, regardless of how they're thrown.\n\n2. \"Il est plus populaire parmi les locaux que parmi les touristes\" (It is more popular among locals than among tourists)\n   - The passage states it's a skill that \"many tourists want to acquire,\" but doesn't compare popularity between locals and tourists.\n\n3. \"Peu de boomerangs sont disponibles en Australie\" (Few boomerangs are available in Australia)\n   - The passage doesn't suggest scarcity of boomerangs, just that most don't return.\n\n4. \"Seuls certains boomerangs peuvent revenir\" (Only certain boomerangs can return)\n   - This aligns perfectly with the passage, which emphasizes you need \"un boomerang conçu pour revenir\" (a boomerang designed to return) and states that \"la plupart des boomerangs disponibles en Australie ne reviennent pas\" (most boomerangs available in Australia do not return).\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify the key information about the match described:\n   - South Africa (Springboks) beat New Zealand (All Blacks) 21-20\n   - This ended the All Blacks' 15-game winning streak\n   - This ended the Springboks' 5-game losing streak\n   - This was the All Blacks' last match (they had already won the trophy)\n\n2. Now I'll look for information about the upcoming match at Ellis Park:\n   - The passage states: \"Le dernier match du championnat aura lieu à l'Ellis Park de Johannesburg la semaine prochaine, lorsque les Springboks affronteront l'Australie\"\n   - Translation: \"The last match of the championship will take place at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks will face Australia\"\n\n3. I need to identify who the Springboks are:\n   - The passage clearly establishes that the Springboks are South Africa's team\n\n4. So the match at Ellis Park will be between:\n   - The Springboks (South Africa) vs Australia\n\n5. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: All Blacks and Australia - Incorrect\n   - Option 2: New Zealand and South Africa - Incorrect\n   - Option 3: South Africa and Australia - Correct\n   - Option 4: Springboks and All Blacks - Incorrect\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about bow symbols and techniques for string instruments (like violin). Let me break down what it says:\n\n1. The \"push\" symbol looks like a V\n2. The \"pull\" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side\n3. \"Up\" means you start from the tip and push the bow\n4. \"Down\" means you start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow\n5. An upward bow generally produces a softer sound\n6. A downward bow is louder and more assertive\n\nNow, the question asks: \"According to the excerpt, which of the following elements is NOT associated with pulling the bow?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. \"A softer sound\" - The passage says an upward bow produces a softer sound, and upward bow means pushing (starting from the tip), not pulling.\n\n2. \"A symbol that resembles a staple\" - The passage says the \"pull\" symbol looks like a staple, so this IS associated with pulling.\n\n3. \"A louder sound\" - The passage says a downward bow is louder, and downward bow means pulling (starting from the frog), so this IS associated with pulling.\n\n4. \"Starting from the frog\" - The passage explicitly says that starting from the frog means pulling the bow, so this IS associated with pulling.\n\nTherefore, option 1 (\"A softer sound\") is NOT associated with pulling the bow - it's associated with pushing the bow.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what happened with the previous electoral council (CEP):\n   - Martelly installed a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with 9 members\n   - This is his fifth CEP in four years\n   - The previous CEP was dissolved\n\n2. Now I need to identify who suggested/recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP:\n   - The passage states: \"Le mois dernier, une commission présidentielle a recommandé la dissolution du précédent CEP\"\n   - This translates to: \"Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP\"\n\n3. The passage explains the context:\n   - This presidential commission was created as Martelly's response to widespread protests\n   - The protests began in October and were sometimes violent\n   - The protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place in 2011\n\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: Martelly - He created the commission but didn't directly suggest the dissolution\n   - Option 2: Protesters - They protested but didn't directly suggest the dissolution\n   - Option 3: The presidential commission - This matches what the passage explicitly states\n   - Option 4: The CEP members themselves - This is not mentioned in the passage\n\nThe passage clearly states that it was the presidential commission that recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses a seasonal disease outbreak in India. Here's what I understand:\n\n1. **Disease transmission**: Pigs carry the disease, which is then transmitted to humans by mosquitoes.\n\n2. **Government measures already implemented**:\n   - Deployment of pig collectors in severely affected areas\n   - Distribution of thousands of mosquito nets\n   - Spraying of pesticides\n\n3. **Future measures**: The government has promised several million bottles of encephalitis vaccine, which will help prepare health agencies for next year.\n\n4. **Key timing information**: The passage states that vaccine delivery plans to historically most affected areas have been delayed this year due to lack of funds and low priority given to these diseases compared to others.\n\nThe question asks: \"According to the excerpt, what will be the last protective measure against the disease to be implemented?\"\n\nLooking at the timeline:\n- Pig collectors, mosquito nets, and pesticides have already been deployed\n- Vaccines are promised but their delivery has been delayed due to funding issues and low priority\n\nSince the vaccines are the only measure mentioned as being delayed and planned for future implementation (specifically to prepare for next year), they will be the last measure to be put in place.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step in English.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses nutritional practices for young athletes. It states that good nutritional practices alone are not sufficient to guarantee elite performance, but they can have a significant impact on young athletes' general well-being. It mentions that maintaining good energy balance, adequate and regular hydration, and good knowledge about nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy their sports practice even more.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the excerpt, which of the following statements is NOT suggested as a way for a young athlete to enjoy their sports practice more?\"\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n1. **Good nutritional practices** - The passage explicitly states that good nutritional practices \"peuvent aider les athlètes à améliorer leurs performances et à se faire encore davantage plaisir\" (can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy themselves even more). This IS suggested.\n\n2. **Regular elite performances** - The passage actually states that good nutritional practices \"ne suffisent pas à elles seules à garantir des performances d'élite\" (are not sufficient alone to guarantee elite performance). While performance improvement is mentioned, \"regular elite performances\" specifically is NOT presented as a means to enjoy sports more.\n\n3. **Adequate hydration** - The passage specifically mentions \"une hydratation adéquate et régulière\" as one of the factors that can help athletes enjoy their practice more. This IS suggested.\n\n4. **Maintaining good energy balance** - The passage explicitly mentions \"Le maintien d'un bon équilibre énergétique\" as one of the factors that can help athletes enjoy their practice more. This IS suggested.\n\nThe passage suggests options 1, 3, and 4 as ways to enhance enjoyment in sports practice, but does not suggest option 2 (regular elite performances) as a means to this end.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe text discusses the transition from 400m to 800m running, explaining that speed becomes much less important while endurance becomes an absolute necessity. It states that an excellent middle-distance runner capable of breaking a two-minute record must possess good speed, but most importantly, perfectly cultivated endurance. It mentions that some cross-country in winter, combined with indoor work for the upper body, is the best preparation for racing season.\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the excerpt, which of the following statements is of paramount importance for an excellent middle-distance runner?\"\n\n**Evaluating each option:**\n\n1. \"Training in cross-country type running in winter\" - This is mentioned as good preparation, but not described as paramount importance.\n\n2. \"Cultivating endurance rather than speed\" - The passage explicitly states that \"endurance becomes an absolute necessity\" and emphasizes that a runner \"must possess good speed, but most importantly, perfectly cultivated endurance.\"\n\n3. \"Breaking a two-minute record\" - This is mentioned as an example of what an excellent runner can do, not as something of paramount importance.\n\n4. \"Cultivating speed rather than endurance\" - This contradicts the passage, which clearly states that endurance is more important than speed for middle-distance running.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe passage clearly emphasizes that endurance is of paramount importance over speed for middle-distance runners, making option 2 the correct answer.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses the protein problem that primates with human-like digestive systems face in the savanna environment.\n\nKey points from the passage:\n1. It's difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to satisfy their amino acid needs from available plant resources in the savanna\n2. Lack of proper nutrition leads to serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition, and ultimately death\n3. The most accessible plant resources would be proteins in leaves and legumes, BUT these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked\n4. In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing large quantities of proteins containing all vital amino acids\n5. The passage suggests our ancestors likely solved their \"protein problem\" similarly to how savanna chimpanzees do today\n\nNow looking at the question: \"According to the information in the extract, which of the following elements should a primate eat to solve its 'protein problem'?\"\n\nOptions analysis:\n1. Dead leaves - These are plant matter, which the passage says is difficult to digest\n2. Raw legumes - The passage specifically mentions legumes are difficult to digest unless cooked, and these are raw\n3. Crickets - These are insects (animal-based food), similar to the ants and termites mentioned as good protein sources\n4. Flower stems - These are plant matter, which would be difficult to digest\n\nBased on the passage's emphasis that animal-based foods like ants and termites are easy to digest and provide complete amino acids, crickets (option 3) would be the best solution to the protein problem.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about satellites and space technology. Let me break down the key information:\n\n1. When you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite\n2. The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantaneously\n3. The satellite was sent to space by a rocket\n4. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision\n5. It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters tall to put a satellite or telescope in space\n\nNow, looking at the question: \"Among the elements below, which one sends long-distance calls back to Earth?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. Telescopes - The passage mentions telescopes are used by scientists to observe because Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision. They are not mentioned as sending calls back to Earth.\n\n2. Satellites - The passage clearly states that \"the satellite receives the call in space then sends it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.\" This directly answers the question.\n\n3. Lights - Lights are only mentioned in the context of being distorted by Earth's atmosphere. They don't send calls back to Earth.\n\n4. Rockets - Rockets are mentioned as the means to send satellites and telescopes into space, but they don't send calls back to Earth.\n\nThe passage explicitly states that satellites receive calls in space and send them back to Earth for long-distance communication.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\n- The passage discusses how Io's gravity would affect someone\n- It states that if you stood on Io's surface, you would weigh less than on Earth\n- It gives a specific example: a person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io\n- It concludes that gravity pulls you less on Io\n\nNow let me analyze what this means about the relative strength of gravity:\n- Since you weigh less on Io than on Earth, this means Io's gravitational pull is weaker than Earth's\n- Weight is the result of gravitational force, so less weight = less gravitational pull\n- Therefore, Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's gravity\n\nNow let me examine each option:\n\n1. \"Earth's gravity would pull you less than Io's gravity\" - This is incorrect. The passage shows the opposite.\n\n2. \"Io's gravity pulls more and that's why you would weigh less\" - This is contradictory and incorrect. If gravity pulled more, you would weigh more, not less.\n\n3. \"Io's gravity pulls more and that's why you would weigh more\" - This is incorrect. The passage clearly states you would weigh less on Io.\n\n4. \"Earth's gravity would pull you more than Io's gravity\" - This is correct. Since you weigh less on Io, Earth's gravity must be stronger (pull more) than Io's gravity.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage describes an incident involving a photographer who was transported to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he died from his injuries. He was reportedly around 20 years old. Bieber made a statement saying he wasn't present or directly involved in the tragic accident. The key information comes from TMZ, which reports what the photographer was doing before the accident.\n\n**Analyzing the photographer's actions:**\nAccording to TMZ, the photographer:\n1. Stopped his vehicle on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard\n2. Attempted to take photos of a police stop\n3. Then crossed the road to continue (taking photos)\n4. This prompted a California Highway Patrol officer to order him to go back, twice\n5. He was then hit by a vehicle\n\n**Examining the question:**\nThe question asks: \"What was the photographer trying to do before being hit by a vehicle?\"\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n1. \"Park on Sepulveda Boulevard\" - The text says he stopped his vehicle, but parking wasn't the main purpose\n2. \"Take photos of the police stop\" - This directly matches what TMZ reported: \"a tenté de prendre des photos de l'arrêt de police\"\n3. \"Cross a busy highway\" - While he did cross the road, this was to continue photographing, not the primary goal\n4. \"Persuade a police officer to let him continue taking photos\" - The officer ordered him back, but there's no mention of the photographer trying to persuade the officer\n\nThe most accurate answer is that he was trying to take photos of the police stop, which is explicitly stated in the passage.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses a warning issued by the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, about \"extremists from Somalia\" who are allegedly planning suicide bomb attacks on Kenyan and Ethiopian soil. The US says they learned from an anonymous source that suicide bombers would be used to blow up \"important sites\" in Ethiopia and Kenya.\n\n**Analyzing the key information:**\n1. The extremists are planning suicide bomb attacks\n2. The attacks are planned for TWO countries: Kenya and Ethiopia\n3. The targets are described as \"important sites\" (sites importants)\n4. The attacks involve bombing these sites in both countries\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n1. \"Blow up bombs at different important sites in a single country\" - This is incorrect because the passage mentions TWO countries (Kenya and Ethiopia), not one.\n\n2. \"Blow up bombs in two countries\" - This is partially correct as it mentions two countries, but it doesn't specify that the targets are important sites.\n\n3. \"Blow up bombs at different important sites in two countries\" - This is the most complete and accurate description. It captures both the fact that there are two countries involved (Kenya and Ethiopia) AND that the targets are specifically \"important sites.\"\n\n4. \"Blow up bombs in a single country\" - This is incorrect because the passage clearly mentions attacks planned for both Kenya and Ethiopia.\n\nOption 3 most accurately describes the supposed plan as it includes both the multi-country aspect and the specific targeting of important sites.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe text describes Kirby Muxloe castle as typical of its era, being more of a fortified house than a true castle. It had glazed bay windows and thin walls that could not have resisted a determined assault for long. In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began its construction, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only necessary against small bands of roving marauders.\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n1. \"The thick walls of the castle were built on Lord Hastings' orders\"\n   - This is INCORRECT. The passage specifically mentions \"minces parois\" (thin walls), not thick walls.\n\n2. \"It didn't need important defenses because the country was peaceful at the time of its construction\"\n   - This is CORRECT. The passage states that in the 1480s the country was \"relativement paisible\" (relatively peaceful) and defense was only needed against small bands of marauders, explaining why strong fortifications weren't necessary.\n\n3. \"The construction of the castle was not typical of its era\"\n   - This is INCORRECT. The passage begins by saying it was \"Typique de l'époque\" (typical of the era).\n\n4. \"It was built to resist determined and prolonged assaults\"\n   - This is INCORRECT. The passage explicitly states that its thin walls and glazed windows \"n'auraient pas pu résister longtemps à un assaut acharné\" (could not have resisted a determined assault for long).\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what the passage is about:\n   - Leslie Aun is a spokesperson for the Komen Foundation\n   - The Komen Foundation adopted a new rule that doesn't allow grants to organizations under judicial investigation\n   - This policy disqualified Planned Parenthood (Planning familial)\n\n2. Now I need to identify which organization is under investigation:\n   - The passage states that Komen's policy \"disqualified Planned Parenthood due to an ongoing investigation\" (a disqualifié le Planning familial en raison d'une enquête en cours)\n   - This investigation concerns how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money\n   - The investigation is being conducted by Representative Cliff Stearns\n\n3. The investigation details:\n   - Cliff Stearns is the chairman of the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee\n   - This subcommittee falls under the House Energy and Commerce Committee\n   - Stearns is investigating whether taxes are used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood\n\n4. Looking at the question: \"Quelle organisation fait l'objet d'une enquête judiciaire?\" (Which organization is the subject of a judicial investigation?)\n\n5. Examining the options:\n   - Option 1: The House Energy and Commerce Committee - this is conducting the investigation, not being investigated\n   - Option 2: The Komen Foundation - this organization made the policy change but is not under investigation\n   - Option 3: Planned Parenthood (Le Planning familial) - this is explicitly stated as being under investigation\n   - Option 4: The Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee - this is conducting the investigation, not being investigated\n\nThe passage clearly states that Planned Parenthood is the organization under investigation.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content**: The passage discusses what triceratops might have eaten, specifically focusing on cycads (cycadées), which were common plants during the Cretaceous period.\n\n2. **Key information about cycads**: The passage describes cycads as plants that resemble small palm trees with a crown of pointed, bristly leaves.\n\n3. **Triceratops feeding behavior**: The passage states that triceratops had powerful teeth capable of crushing not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.\n\n4. **Specific feeding method described**: The crucial sentence states: \"Un tricératops aurait pu utiliser son bec puissant pour enlever les feuilles avant de manger le tronc\" (A triceratops could have used its powerful beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk).\n\n5. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - Option 1 (bristly leaves): The passage suggests these would be removed, not eaten\n   - Option 2 (trunk): The passage explicitly states the triceratops would eat the trunk after removing the leaves\n   - Option 3 (roots): While mentioned as something triceratops could crush, not specifically mentioned as what they would eat from cycads\n   - Option 4 (fruits): Not mentioned in relation to cycads in this passage\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The passage clearly indicates that a triceratops would remove the leaves and then eat the trunk of the cycad plant.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about Goma, a tourist city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda. Here are the key facts from the passage:\n\n1. In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially downtown\n2. While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province\n3. The city is a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano\n4. It's also a starting point for mountain gorilla tracking, among the cheapest in Africa\n5. You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma, with normal local price around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip\n\nNow let me evaluate each option to find which advice would NOT be wise to give to a tourist:\n\nOption 1: \"The fighting in North Kivu is entertaining\" - This is clearly unwise advice. The passage mentions that there is persistent fighting in the province and that visits outside Goma require research to understand the combat situation. Suggesting fighting is \"entertaining\" would be dangerous and inappropriate advice.\n\nOption 2: \"It's the ideal place to track mountain gorillas at an affordable price\" - This aligns with the passage, which states it offers \"among the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.\"\n\nOption 3: \"Motorcycle taxi is a very good means of transport\" - This is supported by the passage, which mentions boda-boda as a way to get around Goma.\n\nOption 4: \"The foot of Mount Nyiragongo volcano is located in the city\" - While not explicitly stated, the passage indicates Goma is the starting point for volcano climbs and was destroyed by its lava, suggesting proximity.\n\nThe question asks which advice is NOT wise to give to a tourist. Option 1 is clearly the most inappropriate and dangerous advice.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\n- The passage discusses ways to see the world at low cost\n- There are two main categories: working while traveling, or limiting expenses\n- The article focuses on the second category (limiting expenses)\n- For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to reduce expenses to nearly zero, they should consult \"minimum budget travel\"\n- The advice assumes travelers don't steal, trespass, participate in illegal markets, beg, or exploit others\n\nNow, let me analyze what the passage says about who might have difficulties with very restricted budget travel:\n\nThe key phrase is that minimum budget travel requires people to be willing to \"sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability\" (sacrifier le confort, le temps et la prévisibilité).\n\nLooking at each option:\n\n1. Someone who likes challenges - This person would likely be fine with budget travel since they enjoy challenges\n2. Someone without time constraints - This person would be fine since budget travel requires sacrificing time, and they have flexibility\n3. Someone intending to work remotely while traveling - This relates to the first category mentioned (working while traveling), not the restrictive budget category being discussed\n4. Someone who appreciates following an itinerary - This person would have difficulties because budget travel requires sacrificing \"predictability\" (prévisibilité), and following a set itinerary requires predictability and planning\n\nThe person who would have the most difficulty is someone who likes to follow a planned itinerary, because this requires predictability, which must be sacrificed for minimum budget travel.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the main content**: The passage discusses the variants of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France. It states that these variants differ slightly from French spoken in France, but are similar enough to be mutually intelligible.\n\n2. **Identifying specific differences mentioned**: The passage specifically mentions:\n   - The numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some small particularities that differ from French spoken in France\n   - The pronunciation of certain words is slightly different\n\n3. **Understanding what remains the same**: The passage notes that all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned standard French at school, so they would be able to understand even if someone used the standard French numbering system.\n\n4. **Analyzing each option**:\n   - Option 1: \"The pronunciation of all words\" - The passage says \"certain words\" have different pronunciation, not ALL words\n   - Option 2: \"The numbering system\" - This is explicitly mentioned as different between France and Belgium/Switzerland\n   - Option 3: \"Standard French taught in school\" - The passage indicates this is the SAME (standard French is taught in all these countries)\n   - Option 4: \"The spelling of certain words\" - This is not mentioned in the passage at all\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The passage clearly states that the numbering system differs between France and Belgium/Switzerland, making this the correct answer.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\n\nThe passage discusses earthquake and volcanic activity in Iceland, specifically around the Hekla region. It mentions:\n- No earthquakes occurred in Iceland in the previous week according to US Geological Survey data\n- No earthquakes in the Hekla region in the last 48 hours according to the Icelandic meteorological office\n- An important earthquake that caused a phase change occurred on March 10th on the northeast face of the volcano's summit caldera\n- Dark clouds unrelated to volcanic activity were reported at the base of the mountain, which could cause confusion about whether a real eruption had occurred\n\nNow, looking at the question: \"According to the excerpt, when did a phase change occur?\"\n\nThe passage clearly states: \"L'important tremblement de terre ayant entraîné le changement de phase a eu lieu le 10 mars\" which translates to \"The important earthquake that caused the phase change occurred on March 10th.\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Before March 10th\n2. In the last 48 hours\n3. March 10th\n4. The previous week\n\nThe passage explicitly states that the earthquake that caused the phase change occurred on March 10th.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses the concept of time and how it can be measured. Key points from the passage:\n\n1. Time surrounds us and affects everything we do, but is difficult to understand\n2. Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years\n3. We experience time as a series of events moving from future to past through the present\n4. Time is also a way to compare the duration (length) of events\n5. You can mark the passage of time by observing the repetition of a cyclical event\n6. A cyclical event is something that occurs regularly/repeatedly\n\nThe question asks: \"What would need to be noted about a cyclical event in order to track the passage of time?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Its duration (Sa durée)\n2. Its repetition (Sa répétition)\n3. What it affects (Ce qu'il affecte)\n4. Its difficulty (Sa difficulité)\n\nThe passage specifically states that \"You can mark the passage of time by observing the repetition of a cyclical event\" and defines a cyclical event as \"something that occurs regularly.\" The key characteristic that allows us to use cyclical events to track time is their repetitive nature - the fact that they repeat at regular intervals.\n\nWhile duration might seem relevant, the passage emphasizes that it's the repetitive/regular occurrence that makes cyclical events useful for tracking time, not specifically measuring their duration.\n\n2",

It mentions:\n\n1. A border dispute that Palestine claims based on pre-1967 Middle East war borders\n2. The future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations\n3. The Jordan Valley issue, where Israel demands a permanent military presence for 10 years from any agreement signing, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to 5 years\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the excerpt, which of the following issues is NOT included in the document?\"\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n1. \"The future of Jerusalem\" - This IS mentioned in the passage (\"le futur État de Jérusalem\")\n\n2. \"The cause of the 1967 war\" - This is NOT mentioned in the passage. The text only references the 1967 Middle East war as a temporal marker for the borders, but does not discuss the causes of that war.\n\n3. \"A military presence in the valley\" - This IS mentioned in the passage (Israel's demand for military presence in the Jordan Valley)\n\n4. \"Border-related conflicts\" - This IS mentioned in the passage (the border dispute based on pre-1967 borders)\n\nThe passage discusses the future of Jerusalem, military presence in the valley, and border conflicts, but it does not address the causes of the 1967 war.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses:\n- Martelly installed a new provisional electoral council (CEP) with 9 members yesterday\n- This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years\n- Last month, a presidential commission recommended dissolving the previous CEP as part of measures to lead the country toward new elections\n- This commission was Martelly's response to vast protests against the regime that began in October\n- These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were supposed to take place in 2011\n\nNow let me examine each option against what the passage states:\n\n1. \"The presidential commission was a response to the protests\" - The passage explicitly states \"Cette commission a été la réponse de Martelly aux vastes protestations\" (This commission was Martelly's response to the vast protests). This IS true.\n\n2. \"The delay in elections triggered protests\" - The passage states \"Ces protestations parfois violentes ont été déclenchées par l'absence d'élections\" (These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections). This IS true.\n\n3. \"The protests demanded the resignation of the former provisional electoral council\" - The passage does NOT state that the protests specifically demanded the resignation of the CEP. It only says the protests were against the regime due to lack of elections, and that the presidential commission (formed in response to protests) recommended dissolving the previous CEP. This is NOT explicitly stated as true.\n\n4. \"The protests were sometimes violent\" - The passage explicitly states \"Ces protestations parfois violentes\" (These sometimes violent protests). This IS true.\n\nThe question asks which statement about the protests is NOT true. Option 3 makes a claim that is not supported by the passage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: Jonny Reid, a co-pilot from the New Zealand A1GP team, legally drove across the Auckland Harbor Bridge in a car called \"Black Beauty.\"\n\n2. **Key details about speed**: \n   - Reid exceeded 160 km/h 7 times while crossing the bridge\n   - The New Zealand police had difficulty using their speed radars to measure Reid's speed\n   - The reason for this difficulty was the low profile/height of the Black Beauty car\n\n3. **The crucial information**: The passage states \"La seule fois où la police a réussi à chronométrer M. Reid, c'est quand il a ralenti à 160 km/h\" which translates to \"The only time the police managed to time Mr. Reid was when he slowed down to 160 km/h.\"\n\n4. **Analyzing the question**: The question asks \"At what moment could the police use their radars to time Jonny Reid's speed?\"\n\n5. **Evaluating the options**:\n   - Option 1: \"When he was driving at 160 km/h\" - This matches exactly with the passage stating the police only succeeded in timing him when he slowed down to 160 km/h\n   - Option 2: \"On his seventh crossing of the bridge\" - No specific mention of timing success on the seventh pass\n   - Option 3: \"When he was driving at more than 160 km/h\" - This contradicts the passage, as the police had difficulty timing him at higher speeds\n   - Option 4: \"On his first crossing of the bridge\" - No specific mention of timing success on the first pass\n\nThe passage clearly states that the police could only successfully time Reid when he slowed down to 160 km/h, not when he was going faster.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll understand what the passage is about:\n   - The passage describes curry as a dish made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables\n   - It explains that curry can be \"solid\" or \"liquid\" depending on the amount of sauce\n   - It then discusses regional variations in ingredients\n\n2. Now I'll focus on the key information about regional differences:\n   - In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan: yogurt is commonly used in curries\n   - In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent: coconut milk is commonly used\n\n3. The question asks: \"In place of which ingredient is coconut milk sometimes used in certain regions?\"\n\n4. Looking at the passage structure, it presents a contrast between two regions:\n   - Northern interior regions use yogurt\n   - Southern coastal regions use coconut milk\n\n5. This suggests that coconut milk and yogurt serve similar functions in curry preparation but are used in different regions - meaning coconut milk is used as a substitute for yogurt in certain areas.\n\n6. Checking the options:\n   - Meat and vegetables are mentioned as accompaniments, not as ingredients that coconut milk replaces\n   - Spices are fundamental to curry and not replaced by coconut milk\n   - Yogurt is the ingredient that's used in northern regions while coconut milk is used in southern regions\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that coconut milk is used instead of yogurt in different regional variations of curry.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage describes a region bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west. It then provides specific advice for women travelers:\n- Women should say they are married regardless of their actual marital status\n- They should wear a wedding ring (but not one that appears too valuable)\n- Women should realize that cultural differences may lead to behaviors they consider harassment\n- It's common for women to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.\n- Women should be firm in refusing men's advances and not be afraid to stand their ground\n- The passage emphasizes that cultural differences don't make such behavior acceptable\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the description of the region made in the extract, what advice would it be wise to give to women who travel?\"\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating each option**\n1. \"Recognize that it is rare to be followed\" - This contradicts the passage, which states it's common (\"courant\") for women to be followed\n2. \"Wear a big wedding ring to highlight one's marital status\" - This contradicts the advice to wear a ring that doesn't seem too precious/valuable\n3. \"Understand that cultural differences push one to avoid standing firm\" - This contradicts the passage, which explicitly advises women to \"hold firm\" and not be afraid to stand their ground\n4. \"In case of unwanted advances, be firm when you reject men's advances\" - This directly matches the passage's advice: \"Soyez ferme dans le refus des avances hommes\"\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nOption 4 accurately reflects the main advice given in the passage about being firm in rejecting unwanted advances from men.\n\n4",

La viande (meat) - This IS mentioned as a base ingredient, specifically pork\n2. Le pain (bread) - This IS mentioned as a base ingredient\n3. Les céréales (cereals/grains) - This is NOT mentioned anywhere in the passage as a base ingredient\n4. Les légumes (vegetables) - This IS mentioned as a base ingredient\n\nThe passage explicitly lists bread, vegetables, and meat as the foundation of Majorcan cuisine, along with olive oil. Cereals/grains are never mentioned in the text.\n\nTherefore, cereals (les céréales) is the ingredient that is not mentioned as a basic food of Majorcan cuisine according to this extract.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about avalanches and what triggers them. Let me break down the key information:\n\n1. Avalanches are normal phenomena - steep slopes can only hold a small amount of snow, and excess snow spreads as avalanches.\n\n2. The problem is that snow sticks together, so if it collapses, there must have been a triggering element.\n\n3. A slight collapse of snow can be the trigger for everything else.\n\n4. The passage then lists what can be triggering elements:\n   - Sometimes it's solar warming on the snow\n   - Sometimes it's just more snow\n   - Other times it can be natural events or human activity\n\nNow I need to identify which of the options does NOT trigger avalanches according to the passage:\n\nOption 1: \"La neige qui colle\" (Snow that sticks) - The passage says snow sticks, but this is described as a characteristic that makes avalanches problematic when they do occur, not as a trigger itself.\n\nOption 2: \"Les humains\" (Humans) - The passage explicitly mentions \"l'activité humaine\" (human activity) as a potential trigger.\n\nOption 3: \"La lumière du soleil\" (Sunlight) - The passage mentions \"le réchauffement solaire sur la neige\" (solar warming on snow) as a trigger.\n\nOption 4: \"Davantage de neige\" (More snow) - The passage explicitly states \"parfois c'est juste davantage de neige\" (sometimes it's just more snow) as a trigger.\n\nThe passage describes snow sticking as a property that makes avalanches dangerous when they occur, but not as a trigger itself. The triggers mentioned are solar warming, more snow, and human activity.\n\n1",

Entendre = To hear\n2. Voir = To see\n3. Marcher = To walk\n4. Parler = To speak\n\nSince the passage explicitly describes Homer as \"le poète aveugle\" (the blind poet), this directly indicates that he could not see. Blindness means the inability to see.\n\nThe passage gives no information suggesting Homer had problems with hearing, walking, or speaking. The only disability mentioned is his blindness.\n\n2",

It mentions that in 2014, Turkish Airlines served 39 destinations in 30 African countries.\n\nThe key part for answering the question is in the last sentence: \"If you have more time to travel, compare the total price of a ticket to Africa with the price of a round-the-world ticket. Don't forget to add the additional costs of visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all these places outside of Africa.\"\n\nThe question asks: \"What should NOT be added when comparing the total price of a ticket to Africa with a round-the-world ticket?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. Additional visa fees for places outside Africa - The passage says TO add these\n2. The cost of departure taxes in Africa - The passage doesn't mention adding departure taxes specifically for Africa\n3. The cost of a visa for Africa - The passage doesn't mention adding visa costs for Africa itself\n4. The cost of ground transportation in places outside Africa - The passage says TO add these\n\nThe passage specifically mentions adding costs \"for all these places outside of Africa\" (pour tous ces endroits en dehors de l'Afrique). This means we should add costs for places outside Africa, but NOT add additional costs for Africa itself, since the Africa ticket price would already include those.\n\nLooking at the options, option 2 (departure taxes in Africa) would be costs within Africa that shouldn't be added as additional costs when comparing, since they would already be included in the Africa ticket price.\n\n2",

The text states the reductions \"will be based on Chinese economic production.\"\n\nOption 2: \"Advice to developing countries regarding pollution\" - He DID mention this. He advised them to avoid the \"pollute first, clean later\" approach.\n\nOption 3: \"A date by which he hopes carbon emissions will be reduced\" - He DID mention this. He specified \"by 2020.\"\n\nOption 4: \"A specific numerical target for emissions reductions\" - He did NOT mention this. The passage explicitly states \"He did not quantify these reductions\" (Il n'a pas chiffré ces réductions).\n\nTherefore, what Mr. Hu did not mention was a specific numerical target for the emissions reductions.\n\n4",

Babylonians built main temples for each god, considered as the god's dwelling\n2. People brought sacrifices to the gods\n3. Priests tried to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals\n4. Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only priests could access\n5. Some pyramidal towers (ziggurats) were built as temple elements, with a special sanctuary for the god at the top\n\nThe question asks: \"According to the excerpt, where would it be impossible to encounter an average Babylonian citizen?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. \"In a temple courtyard, bringing sacrifices\" - The passage states people brought sacrifices to gods, and temples had open courtyards. This would be possible for average citizens.\n\n2. \"At a ceremony in a main temple\" - The passage mentions priests conducted ceremonies, and since people brought sacrifices, average citizens could attend ceremonies. This would be possible.\n\n3. \"At a festival in a temple courtyard\" - The passage mentions festivals and open courtyards where people could go. This would be possible for average citizens.\n\n4. \"In an inner sanctuary, bringing sacrifices\" - The passage explicitly states that inner sanctuaries were accessible \"only to priests\" (\"auquel seuls les prêtres pouvaient accéder\"). Therefore, an average citizen could not be found in an inner sanctuary.\n\nThe answer is clear: average Babylonian citizens would be impossible to encounter in inner sanctuaries since these were restricted to priests only.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step.\n\nThe passage is about light bulb replacement and safety precautions. Let me break down the key information:\n\n1. The passage starts by explaining what happens to a light bulb after hundreds of hours of operation: \"Après des centaines d'heures de fonctionnement, le filament dans l'ampoule finit par brûler et l'ampoule électrique ne marche plus\" (After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the electric bulb no longer works).\n\n2. It then explains that the bulb must be replaced and discusses safety precautions.\n\n3. The safety section mentions turning off the switch or unplugging the cable to avoid electrical shock when touching the metal parts while the bulb is partially inserted.\n\nNow, looking at the question: \"D'après l'extrait, qu'est-ce qui finit par empêcher une ampoule électrique de fonctionner ?\" (According to the excerpt, what eventually prevents an electric bulb from working?)\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. \"Le fait que l'appareil d'éclairage ne soit pas éteint correctement\" (The fact that the lighting device is not turned off properly) - This is mentioned as a safety concern during replacement, not as a cause of bulb failure.\n\n2. \"Le fait que la base métallique de l'ampoule ne soit que partiellement insérée dans la douille\" (The fact that the metal base of the bulb is only partially inserted in the socket) - This is mentioned in the context of safety during installation, not as a cause of failure.\n\n3. \"Le fait que le filament dans l'ampoule ait brûlé\" (The fact that the filament in the bulb has burned out) - This is explicitly stated in the first sentence as the reason why the bulb stops working.\n\n4. \"Le ralentissement du courant électrique dans la douille\" (The slowing down of electric current in the socket) - This is not mentioned in the passage.\n\nThe answer is clearly stated in the opening sentence of the passage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage is about dress code requirements when visiting a monastery and what clothing items can be borrowed there.\n\nKey information from the passage:\n1. Women must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders covered\n2. Most monasteries provide stoles (étoles) to women who arrive without proper covering\n3. Men must wear pants covering their knees\n4. You can borrow this clothing from stock at the entrance\n5. The clothing isn't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts\n6. \"One size fits all for men!\"\n\nNow let me examine what can be borrowed according to the text:\n- Stoles (étoles) - explicitly mentioned as provided by monasteries\n- Skirts (jupes) - mentioned as available to borrow from stock at entrance\n- Pants (pantalons) - mentioned as borrowable clothing for men\n\nWhat about shorts?\n- Shorts are not mentioned anywhere in the passage as being available to borrow\n- In fact, the dress code requires covering knees, which shorts typically don't do\n- The passage only mentions providing appropriate covering garments (skirts, pants, stoles)\n\nThe question asks which clothing item is NOT likely to be borrowed at a monastery.\n\nSince shorts don't meet the dress code requirements (covering knees) and are not mentioned as available items, they would not be provided by the monastery.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage describes rugby matches that started at 10 AM with beautiful weather. It mentions that South Africa, leading the rankings, started well by defeating Zambia (5th in rankings) 26-0. The key sentence states that South Africa seemed rusty in their match against their southern counterparts, but then \"gradually improved throughout the tournament\" (s'est cependant graduellement améliorée au fil du tournoi).\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the excerpt, from when did South Africa's game start to improve?\"\n\n**Examining each option:**\n1. \"Around 10:00 AM\" - This is when matches started, but there's no indication their improvement began at this specific time.\n\n2. \"After tightening their defense\" - The passage mentions their disciplined defense as a strength, but doesn't say their improvement started after tightening defense.\n\n3. \"After losing to Zambia\" - This is incorrect. South Africa won against Zambia 26-0, they didn't lose.\n\n4. \"As the tournament progressed\" - This directly matches the French text \"graduellement améliorée au fil du tournoi\" (gradually improved throughout/as the tournament progressed).\n\nThe passage clearly states that South Africa seemed rusty initially but then gradually improved \"au fil du tournoi\" (as the tournament went on/progressed).\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step in English.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses 20th-century research findings about genetic variation. It states that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed. The passage then explains what different processes do:\n\n1. Mutation adds new genetic variation\n2. Selection removes variation from the pool of expressed variations\n3. Segregation and recombination alternate variations between the two pools each generation\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"What is the process responsible for adding genetic variations?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. Ségrégation (Segregation) - According to the passage, this alternates variations between pools, doesn't add new variation\n2. Recombinaison (Recombination) - According to the passage, this also alternates variations between pools, doesn't add new variation\n3. Mutation - The passage explicitly states \"La mutation ajoute une nouvelle variation génétique\" (Mutation adds new genetic variation)\n4. Exprimée (Expressed) - This refers to one type of reservoir, not a process that adds variation\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe passage clearly and directly states that mutation is the process that adds new genetic variation.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about a player named Bobek and his time at Partizan Belgrade. Let me extract the key information:\n\n1. Bobek was born in Zagreb, the Croatian capital\n2. He became known/famous while playing for Partizan Belgrade\n3. He joined Partizan in 1945 and stayed until 1958\n4. During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 matches\n5. No other player has made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek\n6. In 1995, he was elected as the best player in Partizan's history\n\nNow let me evaluate each option:\n\nOption 1: \"He started playing for Partizan in 1945\"\n- The passage states \"Il le rejoint en 1945\" (He joined them in 1945)\n- This is TRUE\n\nOption 2: \"He played for Zagreb before playing for Partizan Belgrade\"\n- The passage only says he was born in Zagreb, not that he played for a Zagreb team\n- This is NOT stated in the passage\n\nOption 3: \"He played for Partizan until 1995\"\n- The passage says he stayed until 1958 (\"y reste jusqu'en 1958\")\n- 1995 is when he was elected best player in history, not when he stopped playing\n- This is FALSE\n\nOption 4: \"He became famous after being elected best player of Partizan\"\n- The passage says he became known while playing for Partizan (1945-1958), and was elected best player in 1995\n- So he became famous long before 1995\n- This is FALSE\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses how children become aware of racial concepts and racial stereotypes at an early age, and how these stereotypes affect behavior. It gives a specific example: children who identify with a racial minority that is typically perceived as underperforming in school tend to fail in school once they discover the stereotype associated with their race.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the excerpt, the fact that a child knows racial stereotypes could have an impact on which of the following responses?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"The racial minority with which they decide to identify\" - The passage doesn't suggest that knowing stereotypes changes which group children identify with.\n\n2. \"Their behavior\" - The passage explicitly states \"ces stéréotypes ont une incidence sur le comportement\" (these stereotypes have an impact on behavior) and provides a concrete example of how this affects academic performance.\n\n3. \"Their relationships with other children\" - While this might be a logical consequence, the passage doesn't specifically mention relationships with other children.\n\n4. \"Their definition of race\" - The passage doesn't discuss how stereotypes affect children's definition or understanding of what race means.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe passage directly states that racial stereotypes have an impact on behavior and provides a specific example of this impact. Option 2 is the most direct and accurate answer based on the text.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this French passage step by step.\n\n**Passage Translation:**\n\"This is the largest acquisition in eBay's history. The company hopes to diversify its revenue sources and gain popularity in regions where Skype holds a strong position, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\"\n\n**Question Translation:**\n\"What does eBay hope to achieve through the acquisition?\"\n\n**Analysis of eBay's Goals:**\nAccording to the passage, eBay hopes to accomplish two main things through this acquisition:\n\n1. **Diversify revenue sources** - This means expanding beyond their current income streams to reduce dependency on existing business models.\n\n2. **Gain popularity in new regions** - Specifically targeting areas where Skype is already strong: China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n1. \"Consolidate its revenues\" - This suggests strengthening existing revenue streams, but the passage mentions \"diversifying\" revenue sources, not consolidating them.\n\n2. \"Develop in new territories\" - This directly matches the goal of gaining popularity in regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil where Skype is strong.\n\n3. \"Increase its profile\" - While gaining popularity could increase profile, this is too vague compared to the specific territorial expansion mentioned.\n\n4. \"Satisfy its shareholders\" - This isn't mentioned in the passage at all.\n\nThe passage clearly emphasizes geographical expansion into new markets where Skype has established presence.\n\n2"

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage is about: It discusses different estimates of how many people speak Hindi and factors that affect these counts.\n\n2. Now I'll look for the specific information that answers the question about what causes the number of Hindi speakers to vary.\n\n3. The key sentence is: \"Количество носителей языка разнится в зависимости от того, берутся ли в учет очень близкие диалекты\" which translates to \"The number of language speakers varies depending on whether very close dialects are taken into account.\"\n\n4. The question asks: \"According to the given text, what does the number of Hindi speakers depend on?\"\n\n5. Let me examine each option:\n   - Option 1: \"Whether very close dialects to Hindi are taken into account\" - This directly matches what the passage states\n   - Option 2: \"Whether people speaking Urdu are taken into account\" - The passage mentions Urdu but not as a factor affecting speaker counts\n   - Option 3: \"Whether people who understand the language are taken into account\" - The passage mentions understanding but as a separate statistic (up to 800 million understand it)\n   - Option 4: \"Whether people who read the language are taken into account\" - Reading is not mentioned in the passage\n\n6. The passage explicitly states that the number of speakers varies depending on whether very close dialects are included in the count.\n\n1",

Now I need to find the specific information about transportation. The passage states: \"Совершившие террористическую атаку в Мумбаи прибыли на лодке 26 ноября 2008 года\" which translates to \"Those who carried out the terrorist attack in Mumbai arrived by boat on November 26, 2008.\"\n\n3. The question asks: \"Какой вид транспорта использовали боевики, чтобы прибыть в Мумбаи?\" which means \"What type of transport did the militants use to arrive in Mumbai?\"\n\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: Поезд (Train)\n   - Option 2: Самолёт (Airplane) \n   - Option 3: Лодку (Boat)\n   - Option 4: Автомобиль (Car)\n\n5. The passage clearly states they arrived \"на лодке\" (by boat), which directly corresponds to option 3 \"Лодку\" (boat).\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Russian passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is about:\nThe passage discusses traditional medieval castles and how they stir the imagination, evoking images from Arthurian legends. It mentions that even standing among ancient ruins, one can imagine the sounds and smells of long-past battles, hear the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, and sense fear emanating from dungeon pits.\n\nNow, let me identify what IS mentioned in the text that can be associated with medieval castles:\n\n1. \"поединков\" (duels/fights) - YES, this is mentioned\n2. \"рыцарского благородства\" (knightly nobility/chivalry) - YES, nobility/chivalry is mentioned\n3. \"ям в подземельях\" (pits in dungeons) - YES, dungeons are mentioned\n4. The text mentions \"легенды о короле Артуре\" (legends of King Arthur) which are associated with knights\n\nNow let me check each option:\n1. Подземелья (Dungeons) - This IS mentioned (\"ям в подземельях\")\n2. Поединки (Duels) - This IS mentioned directly\n3. Благородство (Nobility) - This IS mentioned (\"рыцарского благородства\")\n4. Рыцари (Knights) - While \"рыцарского\" (knightly) is mentioned, the actual word \"рыцари\" (knights) is NOT directly mentioned in the text\n\nThe question asks what is NOT mentioned in the text as something that can be associated with medieval castles.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is discussing:\n1. The passage mentions Prime Minister Stephen Harper agreeing to send the \"Clean Air Act\" to a multi-party committee for review\n2. There was a 25-minute meeting with NDP leader Jack Layton\n3. Layton requested changes and a complete rewrite of the Conservative Party's environmental bill\n4. There's discussion about federal government intervention in funding Mercy Hospital in Devonport, Tasmania\n5. State government and some federal parliament members criticized this action as an election ploy before November federal elections\n6. Prime Minister John Howard stated this was done only to protect the hospital from reduced funding by the Tasmanian government, with an additional 45 million Australian dollars\n\nNow, looking at the question: \"Who refuted the claim that the 'Clean Air Act' was used as an election ploy?\"\n\nWait, I need to read more carefully. The passage actually discusses TWO different issues:\n1. The Clean Air Act discussion between Harper and Layton\n2. The hospital funding issue in Tasmania\n\nThe question asks about who refuted claims that something was used as an election ploy. Looking at the text, it's the hospital funding (not the Clean Air Act) that was criticized as an election ploy, and it was Prime Minister John Howard who refuted this claim by stating it was done only to protect the hospital from funding cuts.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the \"Clean Air Act\" being used as an election ploy. But in the passage, it's actually the hospital funding that was called an election ploy, not the Clean Air Act. This seems to be a trick question or there's some confusion in the question.\n\nGiven the structure of the passage and who made statements refuting election ploy accusations, the answer would be the Prime Minister (John Howard in the hospital case).\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this Russian passage step by step:\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses traveling across the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter. It mentions:\n- If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, you should find out about cabin location\n- This is because passing through ice creates quite terrible noise that can disturb sleep for sensitive people\n- Cruises to St. Petersburg include city walks\n- Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (conditions should be clarified)\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the given text, what should a passenger check if the cruise takes place in winter?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. Расположение каюты (Cabin location)\n2. Визовые требования (Visa requirements) \n3. Условия (Conditions)\n4. Количество времени в городе (Amount of time in the city)\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe passage specifically states that if you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, you should \"узнайте насчёт расположения каюты\" (find out about the cabin location). This is directly mentioned as something to check specifically for winter cruises because of the noise from ice that can disturb sleep.\n\nThe visa requirements and conditions are mentioned in the context of St. Petersburg cruises generally, not specifically for winter travel. The amount of time in the city is not mentioned at all.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step to identify who is NOT a lawyer among the listed people.\n\nFirst, let me identify what the passage tells us about each person mentioned:\n\n1. **Sakis Kechagioglou** - The passage explicitly states he is a \"famous Greek lawyer\" (знаменитые греческие юристы)\n\n2. **Georg Nikolakopoulos** - Also explicitly mentioned as one of the \"famous Greek lawyers\" along with Kechagioglou\n\n3. **Petros Mantouvalos** - The passage describes him as \"member of parliament and lawyer\" (член парламента и юрист)\n\n4. **Makis Triantafilopoulos** - The passage identifies him as a \"journalist\" (журналист) who revealed information on his popular TV show \"Zoungla\" on Alpha TV channel\n\n5. **Evangelos Kalousis** - Mentioned as a \"supreme judge\" (верховный судья)\n\nNow, looking at the question: \"Who among the listed people is NOT a lawyer?\"\n\nThe options are:\n1. Petros Mantouvalos - explicitly called a lawyer\n2. Sakis Kechagioglou - explicitly called a lawyer  \n3. Georg Nikolakopoulos - explicitly called a lawyer\n4. Makis Triantafilopoulos - called a journalist, no mention of being a lawyer\n\nFrom this analysis, Makis Triantafilopoulos is the only person who is identified by a profession other than lawyer - he is specifically called a journalist who hosts a TV show.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about tropical storm \"Daniella\" in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Let me extract the key information:\n\n1. Daniella is the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season\n2. It formed in the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean\n3. The storm is approximately 3000 miles from Miami, Florida\n4. It has maximum sustained wind speeds of 40 mph (64 km/h)\n5. Scientists from the National Hurricane Center predict it will strengthen to hurricane status by Wednesday\n6. The storm is still far from shore, so it's difficult to assess its potential impact on Caribbean countries and the USA\n\nNow let me evaluate each option to find which statement is NOT true:\n\nOption 1: \"Its influence on Caribbean countries is unknown\" - This is TRUE according to the passage, which states it's \"still difficult to assess its potential impact on Caribbean countries and the USA.\"\n\nOption 2: \"It formed in the Atlantic Ocean\" - This is TRUE. The passage clearly states it \"formed in the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean.\"\n\nOption 3: \"It can develop into a hurricane\" - This is TRUE. The passage states that scientists predict \"by Wednesday 'Daniel' will strengthen to hurricane status.\"\n\nOption 4: \"It is located near the shore\" - This is FALSE. The passage explicitly states the storm is \"approximately 3000 miles from Miami\" and is \"still far from shore.\"\n\nThe question asks which statement is NOT true, so the answer is option 4.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage describes an oil spill incident in Alaska. Let me identify the key information:\n\n1. There was a leak of several thousand barrels of crude oil south of Fairbanks, Alaska\n2. Authorities shut down an 800-mile section of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline\n3. A power outage occurred after routine testing of the fire system\n4. This power outage led to the opening of safety valves and overflow of crude oil near pumping station #9 in Fort Greely\n5. The opening of valves caused pressure release in the system\n6. Oil flowed into a containment area that can hold 55,000 barrels\n7. By Wednesday noon, there was still leakage in the tank vents, possibly due to thermal expansion\n8. Another auxiliary containment area with 104,500 barrel capacity was not yet fully utilized\n\nNow, looking at the question: \"Why did the safety valves open?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. \"There was thermal expansion in the tanks\" - The passage mentions thermal expansion as a possible cause of continued leakage in vents, but not as the reason for the initial valve opening.\n\n2. \"There was a power outage after system testing\" - The passage clearly states that a power outage after routine testing of the fire system led to the opening of safety valves.\n\n3. \"The tanks were completely filled\" - This is not mentioned as the cause in the passage.\n\n4. \"The auxiliary containment area could not hold sufficient volume\" - The passage mentions the auxiliary area was not fully utilized, so this wasn't the cause.\n\nThe passage explicitly states: \"Перебой в электроснабжении после планового тестирования пожарной системы привел к открытию предохранительных клапанов\" (A power outage after routine testing of the fire system led to the opening of safety valves).\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this Russian passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll translate the passage:\n\"Batten occupied 190th place in the list of 400 richest Americans in 2008, his fortune was estimated at 2.3 billion US dollars. He graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Virginia in 1950 and was an important sponsor of this institution.\"\n\n2. Now I'll translate the question:\n\"In favor of what from the listed options did Batten make a donation?\"\n\n3. Let me translate the options:\n1. List of richest Americans\n2. University of Virginia\n3. A significant number of institutions\n4. Colleges of arts and sciences\n\n4. Now I'll analyze what the passage tells us about Batten's donations:\n- The passage states he was \"an important sponsor of this institution\"\n- \"This institution\" refers back to the University of Virginia, which was mentioned in the previous part of the sentence\n- He graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Virginia, and then became a sponsor of \"this institution\" (the University of Virginia)\n\n5. Looking at the options:\n- Option 1 (List of richest Americans) - This makes no sense; you don't donate to a list\n- Option 2 (University of Virginia) - This matches what the passage says about him being a sponsor\n- Option 3 (A significant number of institutions) - The passage only mentions one institution\n- Option 4 (Colleges of arts and sciences) - Too general; the passage specifically mentions the University of Virginia as the institution he sponsored\n\nThe passage clearly states that Batten was an important sponsor of the University of Virginia.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what the passage says about different types of tourism:\n   - Recreational tourism: when people visit places very different from their daily life to relax and have fun. Recreational tourists most often visit public places like beaches, theme parks, and campsites.\n   - Cultural tourism: when the goal of visiting a certain place is to become familiar with its history and culture.\n\n2. Now I need to analyze the question: \"What category of tourism does visiting a museum belong to?\"\n\n3. Let me consider what visiting a museum involves:\n   - Museums are places where people go to learn about history, culture, art, science, etc.\n   - The primary purpose of visiting a museum is educational and cultural enrichment\n   - People visit museums to become familiar with history and culture\n\n4. Comparing this with the definitions from the passage:\n   - Recreational tourism focuses on relaxation and entertainment in places like beaches and theme parks\n   - Cultural tourism focuses on becoming familiar with history and culture of a place\n\n5. Since museums are institutions dedicated to preserving and displaying cultural artifacts, historical items, art, and knowledge, and the primary purpose of visiting them is to learn about history and culture, this clearly fits the definition of cultural tourism provided in the passage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Context**: The passage describes events from September 17, 1939, during what appears to be the invasion of Poland.\n\n2. **Key information**: \n   - Polish defense had been broken by September 17, 1939\n   - Poland's only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead\n   - These plans became irrelevant when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts\n   - This happened after the capture of eastern regions of Poland\n\n3. **Critical phrase**: The passage states this Soviet action was \"в нарушение Рижского мирного соглашения, Советско-Польского пакта о ненападении, и других международных соглашений\" which translates to \"in violation of the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international agreements.\"\n\n4. **Question analysis**: The question asks \"According to the given text, who violated the agreement?\"\n\n5. **Answer evaluation**:\n   - Option 1 (Poles) - No indication in the text that Poles violated any agreement\n   - Option 2 (Romanians) - Not mentioned as violating anything\n   - Option 3 (Ukrainians) - The Ukrainian front mentioned was part of the Soviet Red Army, not independent Ukraine\n   - Option 4 (Soviet Union) - The text explicitly states that the Soviet Red Army's actions violated multiple international agreements\n\nThe passage clearly identifies the Soviet Union as the party that violated the agreements mentioned.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this Russian passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the key information about the \"Clean Air Act\" (Закон о чистом воздухе):\n\n1. Prime Minister Stephen Harper agreed to send the \"Clean Air Act\" to an all-party committee for review before the second reading.\n\n2. This was preceded by a 25-minute meeting with NDP leader Jack Layton at the Parliament on Tuesday.\n\n3. At the meeting with the Prime Minister, Layton requested changes and asked to \"completely rewrite\" the Conservative Party's environmental bill.\n\nThe question asks: \"Who proposed making changes to the 'Clean Air Act'?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. John Howard - He is mentioned in the passage but only in relation to a hospital funding issue in Tasmania, not the Clean Air Act\n2. Conservative Party - They created the original bill, but didn't propose changes to it\n3. Jack Layton - The passage clearly states that \"At the meeting with the Prime Minister, Layton requested changes and asked to 'completely rewrite' the Conservative Party's environmental bill\"\n4. Stephen Harper - He agreed to send the bill to committee but didn't propose the changes\n\nThe passage explicitly states that Jack Layton requested changes and asked to \"completely rewrite\" the environmental legislation during his meeting with the Prime Minister.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Russian passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is about:\nThe passage discusses vision (зрение) and the ability to see. It explains that vision depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, namely the eyes. It mentions that there are many different eye structures with varying complexity depending on the organism's needs. Different constructions provide different capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths, and have different degrees of acuity.\n\nNow, let me look at the question:\n\"От чего зависит способность видеть?\" translates to \"What does the ability to see depend on?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. \"От органов чувств зрительной системы\" - \"On the sensory organs of the visual system\"\n2. \"От потребностей организма\" - \"On the needs of the organism\" \n3. \"От чувствительности к определённым длинам волн\" - \"On sensitivity to certain wavelengths\"\n4. \"От различной степени остроты\" - \"On different degrees of acuity\"\n\nLooking back at the passage, the very first sentence states: \"Зрение, или способность видеть, зависит от органов чувств зрительной системы, а именно глаз\" which translates to \"Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, namely the eyes.\"\n\nThis directly answers the question. While the passage mentions that eye structures vary based on organism needs (option 2), sensitivity to wavelengths (option 3), and degrees of acuity (option 4), these are characteristics of different eye constructions, not what the fundamental ability to see depends on.\n\nThe passage clearly states that the ability to see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage is about bow movements in string instruments (like violin). Let me break down what it says:\n\n1. The upward bow movement sign looks like \"V\"\n2. The downward bow movement sign looks like a bracket or square without the bottom side\n3. \"Up\" means you start from the tip and move the bow forward\n4. \"Down\" means you start from where your hand holds the bow and move it backward\n5. Upward bow movement usually produces a softer sound\n6. Downward bow movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound\n\nThe question asks: \"According to the given text, what from the listed items is NOT associated with moving the bow backward?\"\n\nFrom the passage, moving the bow backward is associated with:\n- Downward bow movement\n- Starting from where the hand holds the bow\n- Producing a stronger and more assertive sound\n- The sign that looks like a bracket\n\nNow let me check each option:\n\n1. \"Softer sound\" - According to the text, this is associated with upward bow movement, NOT backward movement\n2. \"Bracket-like sign\" - This IS associated with downward/backward movement\n3. \"Stronger sound\" - This IS associated with downward/backward movement  \n4. \"Starting from where the hand holds the bow\" - This IS associated with backward movement\n\nTherefore, option 1 (softer sound) is NOT associated with moving the bow backward.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about lions and their social behavior. Let me break down what it says:\n\n1. Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides\n2. A pride consists of 1-3 related adult males, plus females and cubs (up to 30 total)\n3. Females are usually related to each other, forming a family of sisters and daughters\n4. Lion prides behave very similarly to wolf packs or dog packs\n5. These animals (wolves/dogs) are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions but NOT to other big cats\n6. They are also very dangerous to their prey\n\nNow let me examine each option to see which one does NOT accurately describe lion behavior according to the passage:\n\nOption 1: \"They are very social\" - This is directly stated in the passage as true.\n\nOption 2: \"Their behavior is comparable to wolf behavior\" - This is explicitly stated in the passage.\n\nOption 3: \"Males and females are very dangerous to their prey\" - The passage mentions they are \"very dangerous to their victims/prey.\"\n\nOption 4: \"Their behavior is similar to other big cats\" - The passage explicitly states that lions behave like wolves/dogs, which are \"surprisingly similar to lions (but NOT other big cats).\" This directly contradicts what the passage says.\n\nThe passage clearly states that lions' behavior is similar to wolves and dogs, but NOT similar to other big cats. Therefore, option 4 is the statement that does NOT accurately describe lion behavior according to the passage.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The passage describes two classes of suburban trains (MetroRail) in Cape Town: \"MetroPlus\" (first class) and \"Metro\" (third class)\n   - MetroPlus is described as more comfortable and has fewer passengers\n   - MetroPlus is slightly more expensive than Metro, but still cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe\n   - Both types of cars are present in each train\n   - MetroPlus cars are always located at the end of the train closest to Cape Town\n\n2. **Understanding the question:**\n   The question asks: \"What is the advantage of first-class tickets in MetroRail suburban trains in Cape Town?\"\n\n3. **Analyzing each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"The car is located at the beginning of the train\" - This is incorrect. The passage states MetroPlus cars are at the END of the train closest to Cape Town, not the beginning.\n   \n   - Option 2: \"Fewer passengers\" - This is correct. The passage explicitly states that MetroPlus has \"меньше пассажиров\" (fewer passengers).\n   \n   - Option 3: \"Cheaper than third-class ticket\" - This is incorrect. The passage states MetroPlus is \"немного дороже\" (slightly more expensive) than Metro.\n   \n   - Option 4: \"Costs the same as a Metro ticket\" - This is incorrect. The passage clearly indicates MetroPlus costs more than Metro tickets.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The passage directly states that MetroPlus (first class) has fewer passengers, which is mentioned as one of its advantages along with being more comfortable.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage says:\nThe passage discusses that proper nutrition practice alone won't lead to the highest results, but it can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes. It mentions that maintaining healthy energy balance, following effective hydration habits, and understanding various aspects of dietary supplements can help athletes improve their performance and increase enjoyment from sports.\n\nNow, let me examine the question:\nThe question asks what is NOT recommended for young athletes to increase enjoyment from sports, according to the text.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n1. \"Proper nutrition\" - The passage explicitly states that proper nutrition can help athletes increase enjoyment from sports. So this IS recommended.\n\n2. \"Constantly achieving the highest results\" - The passage actually states that \"proper nutrition practice alone will NOT lead to the highest results\" (не приведет к высочайшим результатам). This suggests that constantly pursuing the highest results is not what's being recommended as the path to enjoyment.\n\n3. \"Effective maintenance of water balance\" - The passage specifically mentions \"following effective habits of maintaining water balance\" as something that can help increase enjoyment from sports. So this IS recommended.\n\n4. \"Supporting healthy energy balance\" - The passage explicitly mentions \"maintaining healthy energy balance\" as something that can help increase enjoyment from sports. So this IS recommended.\n\nThe passage emphasizes health and balance rather than pursuing the highest results at all costs. Option 2 represents an approach that contradicts the passage's message about focusing on health and balance rather than just achieving top results.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the main topic**: The passage discusses running training, specifically comparing quarter-mile vs half-mile running and what qualities are most important for each distance.\n\n2. **Key points from the passage**:\n   - When increasing distance from quarter-mile to half-mile, speed becomes less important\n   - Endurance becomes an absolute necessity for half-mile running\n   - A first-class half-mile runner who can run in under two minutes must have considerable speed\n   - BUT (the key word here is \"но\" - \"but\") endurance must be trained \"at all costs\" (во что бы то ни стало)\n   - Cross-country running in winter plus gym work for upper body is recommended as the best preparation\n\n3. **Analyzing the question**: What is most important for a first-class half-mile runner according to the text?\n\n4. **Evaluating each option**:\n   - Option 1: Cross-country running in winter - this is mentioned as good preparation, but not as the MOST important thing\n   - Option 2: Training endurance first, not speed - this aligns with the passage's emphasis that endurance becomes \"absolute necessity\" and must be trained \"at all costs\"\n   - Option 3: Ability to run the distance in under two minutes - this is mentioned as a characteristic of a first-class runner, but not what's most important to develop\n   - Option 4: Training speed first, not endurance - this contradicts the passage, which clearly states endurance becomes more important than speed for half-mile distance\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The passage clearly emphasizes that while speed is still needed, endurance becomes the absolute necessity and must be prioritized in training for half-mile runners.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: The passage discusses the \"protein problem\" that primates with human-like digestive systems face in the savanna environment.\n\n2. **Identifying the problem**: Primates struggle to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources. Failure to do so leads to growth retardation, malnutrition, and death.\n\n3. **Plant protein limitations**: The passage states that while proteins in leaves and legumes would be the most available plant resources, they are poorly absorbed by primates like humans unless cooked.\n\n4. **Animal protein solution**: The text emphasizes that animal-origin food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also a rich source of proteins containing all essential amino acids.\n\n5. **The conclusion**: The passage states that our ancestors solved the \"protein problem\" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today - by consuming animal proteins.\n\n6. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - Option 1: Fallen leaves - these are plant proteins that are poorly absorbed\n   - Option 2: Raw legumes - also plant proteins that are poorly absorbed when uncooked\n   - Option 3: Grasshoppers - these are insects, which fall into the category of animal-origin food mentioned in the passage (like ants and termites)\n   - Option 4: Flower stems - these are plant material, not mentioned as a protein source\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that animal-origin foods (insects like ants and termites) are the solution to the protein problem. Grasshoppers are insects and would fit this category perfectly.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\n- The passage mentions that they now have four-month-old mice that no longer have diabetes\n- Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax and chairman of the clinical-scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association, provides a warning\n- The research is still in early stages\n- Like some other experts, he doubts that diabetes is curable\n- He notes that these findings do not apply to people who have already developed type 1 diabetes\n\nNow, let me look at the question: \"According to the given text, what does Dr. Ur doubt?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. \"Whether the discoveries apply to people who have type 1 diabetes\" - The text says he notes that these discoveries \"do not apply to people who have already developed type 1 diabetes.\" This is stated as a fact, not something he doubts.\n\n2. \"Whether treatment is possible\" - The text specifically states \"he doubts that diabetes is curable\" (он сомневается, что диабет излечим). This directly matches what the question is asking about.\n\n3. \"Other experts' opinions regarding treatment\" - The text mentions he shares doubts with other experts, but doesn't say he doubts their opinions.\n\n4. \"Whether the mice that don't have diabetes will remain so\" - This is not mentioned in the text as something he doubts.\n\nThe key phrase is \"он сомневается, что диабет излечим\" which translates to \"he doubts that diabetes is curable.\" This directly corresponds to option 2 about whether treatment/cure is possible.\n\n2",

First aid (Оказание первой помощи) - The text explicitly states \"большой объем информации по оказанию первой помощи\" (extensive first aid information)\n2. Combat zones (Зоны боевых действий) - The text mentions these zones as the context but doesn't say they're specifically covered in the course content\n3. Wilderness survival (Выживание в диких условиях) - The text mentions books about this exist but doesn't say it's part of the course\n4. Hostile environment (Враждебная среда) - This is the general topic but not specifically mentioned as course content\n\nThe passage explicitly states that the course includes \"extensive first aid information\" as one of its components.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage says about the relationship between humans and plants regarding breathing:\n   - The passage states that plants produce oxygen that humans breathe\n   - It also states that plants absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale\n\n2. Now I'll examine the question: \"What do people exhale that plants inhale?\"\n   - The question is asking about what humans breathe out and plants take in\n\n3. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: Food (пищу) - This doesn't relate to breathing/gas exchange\n   - Option 2: Oxygen (кислород) - The passage says plants PRODUCE oxygen for humans, not that plants inhale oxygen from humans\n   - Option 3: Water (воду) - This isn't mentioned in the context of breathing/gas exchange\n   - Option 4: Carbon dioxide (углекислый газ) - The passage explicitly states that humans exhale carbon dioxide and plants absorb it\n\n4. The passage clearly establishes the gas exchange cycle: humans exhale carbon dioxide, which plants absorb (inhale), while plants produce oxygen for humans to breathe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is carbon dioxide.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage describes Kirby Muxloe Castle, stating that:\n- It's more of a fortified house than a true castle, which was characteristic of that period\n- It has huge glazed windows and thin walls that couldn't withstand a powerful attack for long\n- In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began its construction, the country was relatively peaceful\n- Protection was only needed against small bands of roaming marauders\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n1. \"Thick walls of the castle were erected at Lord Hastings' request\"\n   - This contradicts the passage, which specifically mentions \"thin walls\" (тонкие стены)\n\n2. \"During construction the country was peaceful, so only small fortification was required\"\n   - This aligns with the passage: \"in the 1480s... the country was relatively peaceful, and protection was required only from small bands of roaming marauders\"\n\n3. \"The castle's construction was not characteristic of that time\"\n   - This contradicts the passage, which states it \"is characteristic for that period\" (что является характерным для данного периода)\n\n4. \"The castle was built to withstand powerful and prolonged attacks\"\n   - This contradicts the passage, which says the walls \"could not withstand a powerful attack for long\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption 2 accurately reflects the information in the passage about the peaceful conditions during construction requiring only minimal fortification.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BCE by arson committed by Herostratus\n   - Herostratus sought fame at any cost\n   - The Ephesians declared his name would never enter history, but historian Strabo later mentioned it\n   - The temple was destroyed on the same night Alexander the Great was born\n   - Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the temple's restoration, but his offer was rejected\n   - The temple was restored in 323 BCE, after Alexander's death\n\n2. **Analyzing each option:**\n\n   Option 1: \"Alexander the Great paid for the restoration\"\n   - This is incorrect. The passage clearly states that Alexander offered to pay, but his offer was rejected.\n\n   Option 2: \"The temple was restored after Alexander the Great's reign\"\n   - This appears correct. The passage states the temple was restored in 323 BCE \"after Alexander's death,\" which would be after his reign ended.\n\n   Option 3: \"Herostratus was ordered to cover the restoration costs\"\n   - This is not mentioned anywhere in the passage.\n\n   Option 4: \"The temple was restored in 320 BCE\"\n   - This is incorrect. The passage specifically states it was restored in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   Option 2 is the only accurate statement.

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses what determines stellar activity, including the Sun's activity. Let me break down the key information:\n\n1. The passage states that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars.\n\n2. It was established that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness (яркость/светимость) and rotation (вращение) and nothing else (\"и ничем другим\").\n\n3. The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.\n\n4. The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic field inversions.\n\nNow, analyzing the question: \"What from the listed causes the activity of the Sun and other stars?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Luminosity and plasma flow\n2. Rossby number, rotation and magnetic field inversions\n3. Rotation and luminosity\n4. Luminosity, Rossby number and rotation\n\nThe passage clearly states that stellar activity is determined by brightness/luminosity and rotation \"and nothing else.\" The Rossby number is calculated FROM these two parameters, and plasma flow and magnetic field inversions are consequences or related phenomena, not the determining factors themselves.\n\nThe passage explicitly says activity is determined by luminosity and rotation, making option 3 the direct answer based on the text.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Russian passage step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses a ruling by the Australian Communications and Media Authority regarding \"Big Brother\" and online content censorship laws. The key information is about what constitutes internet content under broadcasting law.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the key legal principle**\nThe passage states that \"Big Brother\" did not violate online content censorship laws because the multimedia material was not stored on the \"Big Brother\" website. The crucial sentence is: \"Broadcasting law regulates internet content, however for something to be considered internet content, it must physically be located on a server.\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"What parameters must multimedia material satisfy to be considered internet content?\"\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating each option**\n1. \"Must be broadcast on the Internet\" - The passage shows this is NOT sufficient, as the video was broadcast online but wasn't considered internet content under the law.\n\n2. \"Must physically be located on a server\" - This directly matches the legal requirement stated in the passage: \"что бы что-то считалось интернет-контентом, оно должно физически находится на сервере\" (for something to be considered internet content, it must physically be located on a server).\n\n3. \"Cannot be stored on a website\" - This is backwards; the passage implies content MUST be stored to be regulated.\n\n4. \"Must be approved by the Australian Communications and Media Authority\" - This is not mentioned as a requirement in the passage.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly states that for something to be considered internet content under broadcasting law, it must physically be located on a server.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll understand what the passage is saying about the Sun's structure:\n   - The Sun has no crust/bark like Earth that you could stand on\n   - The entire Sun consists of gases, fire, and plasma\n   - As you move away from the Sun's center, the gas becomes more rarefied/thin\n   - The outer part that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere\n   - Photosphere means \"sphere of light\"\n\n2. Now I'll examine the question: \"According to the given text, which part of the Sun is visible from Earth?\"\n\n3. Let me evaluate each option:\n   - Option 1 (Кора - Crust/bark): The passage explicitly states the Sun has no crust like Earth\n   - Option 2 (Плазма - Plasma): While plasma is mentioned as part of the Sun's composition, it's not specifically identified as the visible part\n   - Option 3 (Фотосфера - Photosphere): The passage clearly states \"The outer part, which we see when we look at the Sun, is called the photosphere\"\n   - Option 4 (Центр - Center): The center is mentioned but not as the visible part\n\n4. The passage directly answers the question by stating that the photosphere is \"the outer part, which we see when we look at the Sun.\"\n\n3",

The passage mentions several groups:\n   - Guaraní: described as the most significant indigenous group in eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture\n   - Guaykuru and Payagua: indigenous tribal groups in the Chaco region who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing\n   - Spanish conquistadors: mentioned in the context of their encounter with local indigenous groups\n\n3. The key sentence is: \"В XVI веке Парагвай... возник в результате столкновения испанских завоевателей с местными группами коренного населения. Испанцы начали период колонизации, который длился три столетия.\"\n\n4. This translates to: \"In the 16th century Paraguay... emerged as a result of the collision of Spanish conquistadors with local indigenous population groups.

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about avalanches and explains:\n\n1. Avalanches are not anomalies - steep slopes can only hold a limited amount of snow\n2. Excess volumes of snow come down as avalanches\n3. Snow is \"sticky/clingy\" (цепкий), so some impact/influence is needed to make it slide down\n4. A small amount of sliding snow can become the trigger for the rest of the mass\n5. Triggering factors can include: sun heating the snow, more snowfall, other natural phenomena, or often humans\n\nNow let me examine the question: \"According to the text, what comes down as avalanches?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n1. \"Sticky snow without external influence\" - This contradicts the text, which says snow is sticky and NEEDS some influence to slide down\n\n2. \"Steep snow-free slopes\" - This makes no sense; slopes themselves don't come down as avalanches\n\n3. \"Excess volumes of snow on steep slopes\" - This directly matches what the text states: \"его избыточные объемы сходят в виде лавин\" (excess volumes come down as avalanches)\n\n4. \"Snow that hasn't been affected by humans\" - The text doesn't specify that only human-unaffected snow creates avalanches; it mentions humans as one of several possible triggers\n\nThe text clearly states that excess volumes of snow come down as avalanches from steep slopes that can only hold a limited amount.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage describes lion prides and their social structure. Let me break down what it says:\n\n1. Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides\n2. A pride consists of 1-3 adult males who are related to each other\n3. The pride also includes females and cubs, up to 30 total\n4. Females are usually related to each other - sisters and daughters forming a large family\n5. Lion prides behave very similarly to wolf or dog packs\n6. These animals have behaviors surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey\n\nNow let me examine each option:\n\nOption 1: \"Their behavior is similar to dog pack behavior\" - This is directly stated in the passage as true.\n\nOption 2: \"The ratio of males to females is not equal\" - This is true according to the passage (1-3 males vs. many more females and cubs up to 30 total).\n\nOption 3: \"Males and females are related\" - The passage states that males are related to each other, and females are related to each other (sisters and daughters), but it does NOT say that males and females are related to each other. This appears to be inaccurate.\n\nOption 4: \"They are simultaneously dangerous and social\" - This is supported by the passage which describes them as social and mentions they are dangerous to their prey.\n\nThe question asks which statement does NOT accurately describe a lion pride. Option 3 incorrectly suggests that males and females in the pride are related to each other, when the passage only mentions that males are related among themselves and females are related among themselves.\n\n3",

Now I need to focus on what the passage specifically says about the Barcelona metro announcements:\n   - Regular announcements in the metro are made ONLY in Catalan (\"Обычные объявления в метро делаются только на каталонском языке\")\n   - However, unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese\n\n3. The question asks specifically about which language is used for regular announcements (\"обычные объявления\") in Barcelona's metro.\n\n4. According to the passage, regular metro announcements are made only in Catalan.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. English - mentioned only for unplanned disruptions\n2. Catalan - explicitly stated as the language for regular announcements\n3. Spanish - mentioned only for unplanned disruptions\n4. French - mentioned only for unplanned disruptions\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage is about: It discusses Arthur Guinness signing a 9000-year lease contract for St James' Gate Brewery in Dublin, Ireland on September 24, 1759.\n\n2. Next, I'll look for the key information related to the question: The passage states that 250 years later, Guinness became a global company with annual revenue exceeding 10 billion euros (14.7 billion US dollars).\n\n3. Now I'll examine the question: \"How many billions of dollars does Guinness bring in annually (approximately)?\"\n\n4. Looking at the passage, it specifically mentions two figures for annual revenue:\n   - Over 10 billion euros\n   - 14.7 billion US dollars\n\n5. Since the question asks for the amount in dollars, I need to focus on the dollar figure: 14.7 billion US dollars.\n\n6. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: 9 (this refers to the 9000-year lease, not revenue)\n   - Option 2: 250 (this refers to the time period, not revenue)\n   - Option 3: 14 (this matches the 14.7 billion dollars, rounded)\n   - Option 4: 10 (this refers to the euro amount, not dollars)\n\n7. The question asks for the approximate amount in dollars, and 14.7 billion rounds to approximately 14 billion.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Russian passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify the key information about Schumacher's career end:\n   - The passage states \"Шумахер, который закончил карьеру в 2006 году после того, как стал семикратным чемпионом\"\n   - This translates to \"Schumacher, who ended his career in 2006 after becoming a seven-time champion\"\n\n2. Now I'll examine what the passage says about the sequence of events:\n   - Schumacher ended his career in 2006\n   - He became a seven-time champion before ending his career\n   - Felipe Massa's accident happened in 2009 (three years after Schumacher's retirement)\n   - Schumacher was supposed to replace the injured Massa\n\n3. Let me analyze each option:\n   - Option 1: \"After Felipe Massa's accident\" - This is incorrect because Massa's accident was in 2009, but Schumacher retired in 2006\n   - Option 2: \"After his seventh championship victory\" - This matches the passage, which says he ended his career after becoming a seven-time champion\n   - Option 3: \"After replacing Felipe Massa\" - This is incorrect because the replacement was supposed to happen after his retirement\n   - Option 4: \"At the end of the 2009 season\" - This is incorrect because he retired in 2006\n\n4. The passage clearly states that Schumacher ended his career in 2006 after becoming a seven-time champion, which directly corresponds to option 2.\n\n2",

First, I need to understand what the passage is about: It discusses golf and rugby returning to the Olympic Games program after a vote by the International Olympic Committee in Berlin.\n\n2. The passage mentions that rugby (specifically rugby union) and golf were chosen over five other sports for consideration in the Olympic program.\n\n3. The passage then lists several sports that were trying to be included: squash, karate, and roller skating.\n\n4. Importantly, the passage specifically mentions baseball and softball, stating that these sports \"were excluded from the Olympic Games in 2005 as a result of voting\" (были исключены из Олимпийских игр в 2005 году).\n\n5. Now looking at the question: \"Which of the listed sports were excluded from the Olympic Games program?\"\n\n6. Examining the options:\n   - Option 1: Squash - The passage says squash was trying to be included, but doesn't say it was previously excluded\n   - Option 2: Rugby - The passage says rugby is returning/being included, not excluded\n   - Option 3: Baseball - The passage explicitly states that baseball was excluded in 2005\n   - Option 4: Karate - The passage says karate was trying to be included, but doesn't say it was previously excluded\n\nThe passage clearly states that baseball (and softball) were excluded from the Olympic Games in 2005, making baseball the correct answer.\n\n3",

The passage mentions that this cultural event is part of Bucharest's mayor's campaign to transform Romania's capital into a vibrant creative metropolis.\n\n3. The text specifically states: \"Этот город станет первым городом юго-восточной Европы, в котором пройдёт CowParade\" which translates to \"This city will become the first city in southeastern Europe where CowParade will take place.\"\n\n4. The \"этот город\" (this city) refers back to Bucharest, which was mentioned in the previous sentence as \"столицы Румынии\" (Romania's capital).\n\n5. The passage clearly indicates that CowParade will take place in Bucharest specifically, not in multiple Romanian cities, not throughout southeastern Europe, and not in several European capitals.\n\n6. The question asks \"Где пройдёт CowParade?\" (Where will CowParade take place?)\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Option 1: In several Romanian cities - not supported by the text\n- Option 2: In Bucharest - directly supported by the passage\n- Option 3: Throughout southeastern Europe - contradicted by the text saying Bucharest will be the first city in southeastern Europe to host it\n- Option 4: In several European capitals - not supported by the text\n\n2",

      "Let me analyze this Russian passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\n\nThe passage discusses shopping for food in supermarkets as typically the cheapest way to eat. It mentions that when people can't cook, they're limited to ready-to-eat food. Then it states that supermarkets are increasingly expanding the assortment of their ready-food departments. Some even provide microwaves or other means to heat food. In some countries or certain store formats, there's at least one simple restaurant with affordable prices.\n\nNow, let me look at the question:\n\"According to the given text, what are supermarkets starting to offer a more diverse selection of?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. Ready food (Готовая еда) - The passage specifically states \"Все чаще супермаркеты расширяют ассортимент отделов готовой еды\" which translates to \"Supermarkets are increasingly expanding the assortment of ready-food departments.\"\n\n2. Microwave ovens (Микроволновые печи) - The text mentions that some supermarkets provide microwaves, but doesn't say they're offering a more diverse selection of microwaves.\n\n3. Restaurants on supermarket territory (Рестораны на территории супермаркета) - The text mentions restaurants exist in some stores, but doesn't indicate supermarkets are expanding the variety of restaurants.\n\n4. Affordable prices (Доступные цены) - The text mentions affordable prices but doesn't suggest supermarkets are offering more diverse pricing options.\n\nThe key phrase is \"расширяют ассортимент отделов готовой еды\" (expanding the assortment of ready-food departments), which directly indicates that supermarkets are offering a more diverse selection of ready food.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses events from Formula 1 racing:\n\n1. First, it describes an incident at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix where Piquet Jr. crashed right after Fernando Alonso's early pit stop, which caused the safety car to be deployed.\n\n2. When the cars ahead of Alonso went to refuel under the safety car, Alonso moved up to take the victory.\n\n3. The final sentence states that Piquet Jr. was not allowed to race after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.\n\nNow let me examine the question: \"Which statement accurately describes the result of the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Fernando Alonso was involved in an accident - The passage doesn't mention Alonso having an accident at Hungary 2009\n2. Piquet Jr. achieved victory - The passage doesn't mention Piquet Jr. winning Hungary 2009\n3. Piquet Jr. was fired after this - The passage states he \"was not allowed to race after the Hungarian Grand Prix 2009,\" which indicates he was dismissed/fired after this race\n4. The safety car was involved in an accident - The passage doesn't mention the safety car having an accident at Hungary 2009\n\nThe passage clearly states that Piquet Jr. was not permitted to race after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, which directly corresponds to option 3 - he was fired/dismissed after this race.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to identify what the police were guarding according to the text.\n\n2. Looking at the passage, it mentions that the protest began around 11:00 local time on Whitehall street \"opposite the police-guarded entrance to Downing Street, the official residence of the Prime Minister.\"\n\n3. The key phrase is \"напротив охраняемого полицией въезда на Даунинг-стрит\" which translates to \"opposite the police-guarded entrance to Downing Street.\"\n\n4. This clearly states that the police were guarding the entrance to Downing Street.\n\n5. Let me check the other options mentioned in the text:\n   - Trafalgar Square is mentioned as a location the protesters passed by, but no mention of police guarding it\n   - The Spring Forum is mentioned as an event happening at the hotel, but no specific mention of police guarding it\n   - The Grand Connaught Rooms hotel is mentioned as the venue, but again no specific mention of police guarding it\n\n6.

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses a theoretical study about dark matter interactions between galaxies. Let me break down the key points:\n\n1. The work was mainly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.\n\n2. The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the Sagittarius galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.\n\n3. The passage uses an analogy: just as the Moon attracts Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.\n\n4. Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.\n\n5. According to this theory, a significant part of dark matter around the Galaxy is arranged in a halo form and consists of many small particles.\n\nNow, looking at the question: \"Scientists observed the matter of what from the listed options?\"\n\nThe key information is that:\n- A program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy\n- The study focused on tidal forces between dark matter of the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way\n- The Moon-Earth analogy is just used for explanation, not as objects of study\n\nThe scientists were studying the interaction between the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way, specifically their dark matter interactions.\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Milky Way and Moon - Moon is just used in analogy\n2. Earth and Sagittarius galaxy - Earth is just used in analogy\n3. Earth and Moon - Both are just used in analogy\n4. Sagittarius galaxy and Milky Way - These are the actual objects being studied\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The passage discusses annual festivals held in most temples\n   - These festivals run from late November to mid-May\n   - The dates depend on each temple's annual calendar\n   - Most temple holidays are celebrated for temple anniversaries, central deity birthdays, or other significant temple-related events\n   - Temple festivals in Kerala are interesting to observe\n   - They are accompanied by constant processions of decorated elephants, temple orchestra performances, and other celebrations\n\n2. **Analyzing the question:**\n   - The question asks: \"Where can you see decorated elephants?\"\n\n3. **Evaluating each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"Everywhere from late November to mid-May\" - This is too broad and not what the passage states\n   - Option 2: \"In temples\" - This is partially correct but not specific enough\n   - Option 3: \"In processions during temple festivals\" - This matches exactly what the passage says: \"they are accompanied by constant processions of decorated elephants\"\n   - Option 4: \"On the streets in Kerala\" - While Kerala is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically say \"on the streets\"\n\n4. **Finding the most accurate answer:**\n   The passage specifically states that temple festivals \"are accompanied by constant processions of decorated elephants.\" This directly corresponds to option 3, which is the most precise and accurate answer based on the text.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content**: The passage discusses research from the 20th century that identified two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.\n\n2. **Identifying key processes mentioned**: The passage mentions several genetic processes:\n   - Mutation (мутация)\n   - Selection (отбор)\n   - Segregation (сегрегация)\n   - Recombination (рекомбинация)\n\n3. **Analyzing what each process does according to the passage**:\n   - Mutation: \"introduces new genetic variation\" (вносит новую генетическую вариацию)\n   - Selection: \"removes variation from the set of expressed variations\" (убирает её из набора проявляющихся вариаций)\n   - Segregation and recombination: \"shuffle variations between the two pools with each generation\" (тасуют вариации между двумя пулами)\n\n4. **Matching the question to the passage**: The question asks \"Which process is responsible for introducing genetic variation?\" (Какой процесс отвечает за внесение генетической вариации?)\n\n5. **Finding the direct answer**: The passage explicitly states that \"Mutation introduces new genetic variation\" (Мутация вносит новую генетическую вариацию).\n\n6. **Checking the options**:\n   - Option 1: Segregation - shuffles existing variations\n   - Option 2: Recombination - shuffles existing variations\n   - Option 3: Mutation - introduces new genetic variation\n   - Option 4: Expressed variability - this is a type of variation, not a process\n\nThe passage clearly states that mutation is the process responsible for introducing new genetic variation.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - Hostels are mainly intended for young people\n   - Typical guests are aged 20-30 years old\n   - You can often meet older travelers there too\n   - Families with children are rarely seen there\n   - Some hostels allow families to stay in separate rooms (not shared rooms)\n\n2. **Understanding the question:**\n   The question asks: \"According to the text, which guests are less likely to be encountered in a shared room of a hostel?\"\n\n3. **Analyzing each option:**\n   - Option 1: Young guests in their early twenties - These are explicitly mentioned as typical hostel guests, so they would be very likely in shared rooms\n   - Option 2: Individual travelers - These would be common in hostels and shared rooms\n   - Option 3: Guests traveling with small children - The text says families with children are \"rarely seen\" and when they do stay, some hostels allow them in \"separate rooms\" (not shared ones)\n   - Option 4: Guests around 35 years old - The text says older travelers can \"often\" be met there\n\n4. **Key insight:**\n   The passage specifically mentions that families with children are rare, and when they do stay, it's in separate rooms rather than shared accommodations. This directly answers what type of guests would be less likely in shared rooms.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses how children develop awareness of racial stereotypes at an early age and how these stereotypes affect behavior. It gives a specific example: there's a stereotype that children from racial minorities perform poorly in school, and once children who identify as racial minorities learn about this stereotype, they immediately stop performing well academically.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the given text, knowledge of racial stereotypes can influence a child in which of the listed aspects?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"The racial minority group that the child identifies with\" - The passage doesn't suggest that knowing about stereotypes changes which group a child identifies with.\n\n2. \"Behavior\" - The passage explicitly states that racial stereotypes \"влияют на поведение\" (affect behavior) and gives a concrete example of how learning about academic stereotypes causes children to stop performing well in school, which is a behavioral change.\n\n3. \"Relationships with other children\" - While this might be a logical consequence, the passage doesn't specifically mention relationships with other children.\n\n4. \"The child's definition of race\" - The passage doesn't discuss how children define race or how stereotypes might change these definitions.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the correct answer**\nThe passage directly states that racial stereotypes affect behavior and provides a clear example of this behavioral impact. The text explicitly mentions that children's academic performance (a behavior) changes after they learn about the stereotype.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand the rule for when permits become available. The passage states that permits become available on the 1st day of the month, four months before the start month.\n\n2. The passage gives an example: permits for visits starting in any day of May become available on January 1st. Let me verify this follows the rule:\n   - Start month: May (5th month)\n   - Four months before May: January (1st month)\n   - So permits become available January 1st ✓\n\n3. Now I need to apply this rule to August:\n   - Start month: August (8th month)\n   - Four months before August: April (4th month)\n   - So permits for August visits become available on April 1st\n\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: January 1st (this would be for May visits, as given in the example)\n   - Option 2: April 1st (this matches my calculation for August)\n   - Option 3: May 1st (this would be for September visits)\n   - Option 4: August 1st (this would be the same month, not four months prior)\n\nThe correct answer is April 1st, which corresponds to option 2.\n\n2"

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses Beijing hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics. It states that:\n- Beijing will become the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics\n- In Beijing, the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor ice sports will be held\n- Additionally, ski competitions will be held at Taizicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou City, which is about 220 kilometers (140 miles) away from Beijing\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the content in the passage, which of the following will NOT be held in Beijing in 2022?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. Opening ceremony - The passage states this WILL be held in Beijing\n2. Events at Taizicheng Ski Resort - The passage states this will be held in Zhangjiakou City, which is 220km away from Beijing, so this will NOT be held in Beijing\n3. Closing ceremony - The passage states this WILL be held in Beijing\n4. Indoor ice sports - The passage states this WILL be held in Beijing\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Taizicheng Ski Resort events are specifically mentioned as being held in Zhangjiakou City, not in Beijing. This is the only option that will not take place in Beijing according to the passage.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying about virtual teams vs traditional teams:\n\n1. The passage states that virtual teams are required to have the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.\n\n2. Virtual team members often function as liaisons for their direct physical groups.\n\n3. Virtual teams may hold meetings according to time zones, but this is often not well understood by local management, so members often have higher autonomy than traditional team members.\n\n4. The existence of a true \"invisible team\" (management above each member) is also a unique element of virtual teams. This invisible team sets standards for each member.\n\nNow let me examine each option:\n\nOption 1: \"Both teams are required to have the same level of performance/results\"\n- The passage explicitly states that virtual teams are required to have \"the same level of excellence\" (同じ水準の卓越性) as traditional teams. This directly matches what the passage says.\n\nOption 2: \"Both teams have various levels of autonomy in daily routines\"\n- The passage actually suggests virtual team members have MORE autonomy than traditional team members, not that they have the same levels.\n\nOption 3: \"Both teams are under the supervision of invisible management\"\n- The passage presents the \"invisible team\" as a unique element of virtual teams, not something shared with traditional teams.\n\nOption 4: \"Both teams function in the same time zone\"\n- The passage mentions that virtual teams may hold meetings according to time zones, implying they work across different time zones, unlike traditional teams.\n\nThe passage clearly states that virtual teams require the same level of excellence as traditional teams, making this the similarity between them.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what the passage is about:\nThe passage discusses traditional medieval castles and how they capture people's imagination, evoking images of jousting tournaments, banquets, and Arthurian knights. It describes standing among thousand-year-old ruins and imagining the sounds and smells of ancient battles, the sound of hooves on cobblestones, and the smell of fear rising from dungeon holes. The passage then questions whether our imagination is based on reality and asks why castles were built and how they were designed and constructed.\n\nNow I'll check what is specifically mentioned in the passage:\n\n1. 地下牢の穴 (dungeon holes) - YES, explicitly mentioned: \"地下牢の穴から恐怖の匂いを嗅いが立ち上る\"\n\n2. 馬上槍試合 (jousting tournaments) - YES, explicitly mentioned: \"馬上槍試合、酒宴、アーサー王の騎士の姿を彷彿とさせます\"\n\n3. 騎士道 (chivalry/code of chivalry) - NOT directly mentioned. While knights (騎士) are mentioned in relation to King Arthur, the concept of chivalry as a code of conduct is not explicitly discussed.\n\n4. 騎士団 (knightly orders/orders of knights) - NOT directly mentioned. Again, while knights are mentioned, specific knightly orders or organizations are not discussed.\n\nBetween options 3 and 4, I need to determine which is more clearly absent. The passage mentions \"アーサー王の騎士\" (Knights of King Arthur) but does not mention either the philosophical concept of chivalry (騎士道) or organized knightly orders (騎士団).\n\nHowever, 騎士団 (knightly orders) refers to specific organized groups of knights, which is more concrete and clearly not mentioned in the passage, whereas 騎士道 (chivalry) could be somewhat implied by the romantic imagery of Arthurian knights.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content**: The passage discusses Indonesian cuisine, which encompasses various regional dishes from over 17,000 islands. When used without additional qualifiers, \"Indonesian cuisine\" typically refers to dishes from central to eastern Java.\n\n2. **Focus on Javanese cuisine**: The passage specifically mentions that Javanese cuisine has spread widely throughout the archipelago and is characterized by simple seasoning.\n\n3. **Identifying the main seasonings**: The passage lists the main seasonings used in Javanese cuisine as:\n   - Peanuts (ピーナッツ)\n   - Chili peppers (唐辛子)\n   - Sugar, specifically Javanese coconut sugar (砂糖、特にジャワのココナッツシュガー)\n   - Various spices (さまざまな香辛料)\n\n4. **Analyzing the question**: The question asks which type of sugar is overwhelmingly used in Javanese cuisine.\n\n5. **Examining the options**:\n   - Option 1: White sugar (白い砂糖)\n   - Option 2: Powdered sugar (粉砂糖)\n   - Option 3: Coconut sugar (ココナッツシュガー)\n   - Option 4: Brown sugar (黒砂糖)\n\n6. **Finding the answer**: The passage explicitly states that sugar is used as a main seasoning, and specifically mentions \"特にジャワのココナッツシュガー\" (especially Javanese coconut sugar), which directly corresponds to option 3.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage is about:\nThe passage describes a situation where passengers were stuck on a roller coaster during hot weather (90 degrees Fahrenheit). Water was distributed to passengers while they waited in the heat.\n\n2. Next, I'll identify who made comments in the passage:\nThe passage mentions that Fire Captain Scott Koons (消防隊のスコット・クーンズ隊長) made a statement about the situation.\n\n3. Now I'll examine what Scott Koons said:\nHe commented that it was an extremely hot day in Santa Clara with temperatures exceeding 90 degrees, and that being trapped on a roller coaster is uncomfortable regardless of duration - it took over an hour to get the first person down.\n\n4. The question asks: According to the passage content, who commented about the uncomfortable level of heat?\n\n5. Looking at the options:\n- Option 1: Ride operator (乗り物の操作係)\n- Option 2: Fire captain (消防隊長)\n- Option 3: Passengers (乗客)\n- Option 4: Police chief (警察署長)\n\n6. From my analysis, it was Fire Captain Scott Koons who made the comment about the uncomfortable heat and the unpleasant situation of being trapped on the roller coaster in such weather.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage explains that stars emit light and heat because when hydrogen atoms combine (fuse) to form heavier elements, energy is produced. Scientists are working on developing nuclear reactors that can generate energy in the same way. However, solving this problem is very difficult, and it will take many years before practical fusion reactors can be built.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the content in the text, what does fusion enable stars to do?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. Formation of heavy elements - While the passage mentions that hydrogen atoms fuse to become heavier elements, this is described as the process, not what fusion enables stars to do as a result.\n\n2. Construction of nuclear fusion reactors - This is what scientists are trying to do, not what stars do.\n\n3. Emission of light and heat - The passage clearly states that stars emit light and heat because of the energy produced when hydrogen atoms fuse.\n\n4. Creation of hydrogen atoms - The passage says hydrogen atoms combine/fuse, not that they are created.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the correct answer**\nThe passage directly states that the reason stars emit light and heat is due to the energy produced from hydrogen fusion. Therefore, fusion enables stars to emit light and heat.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify what the passage says about Charles and what he did that was a \"first\":\n\nThe passage states that traditionally, heirs to the throne enter the military directly after graduating from school. However, Charles went to Trinity College at Cambridge University instead, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, later studied history, and obtained a 2:2 (second-class degree).\n\n2. The key sentence is the last one: \"チャールズは英国王室で初めて学位を取得した人物です\" which translates to \"Charles is the first person in the British royal family to obtain a degree.\"\n\n3. Now I'll examine each option:\n   - Option 1: \"学校卒業前の入隊\" (Enlisting before graduating from school) - This is not mentioned as something Charles did first\n   - Option 2: \"考古学の研究\" (Archaeological research) - While Charles studied archaeology, the passage doesn't say he was the first royal to do this\n   - Option 3: \"学位取得\" (Obtaining a degree) - This matches exactly what the passage explicitly states Charles was the first to do\n   - Option 4: \"トリニティ・カレッジ進学\" (Entering Trinity College) - The passage doesn't say he was the first royal to attend Trinity College\n\n4. The passage clearly and explicitly states that Charles was the first in the British royal family to obtain a degree.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage explains that scaffolding goes beyond project-based learning. It describes scaffolding not as a learning method itself, but as support for people who are using new computer programs, starting new projects, or having new learning experiences. The passage mentions that scaffolding can be both virtual and real - teachers are a form of scaffolding, as is Microsoft Office's clip character. Virtual scaffolds are built into software to provide questions, instructions, and explanations for steps that students might find difficult to do alone.\n\n**Key characteristics of scaffolding from the passage:**\n- Provides support for new experiences/programs/projects\n- Can be virtual or real (human)\n- Helps with steps that would be difficult to do alone\n- Includes teachers and software assistants as examples\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n1. **Computer game tutorial at startup** - This is virtual scaffolding built into software to help users learn new programs/games. This fits the definition.\n\n2. **SAT instructor** - This is a human teacher providing support for learning, which the passage explicitly mentions as a form of scaffolding.\n\n3. **Self-study program** - This involves learning independently without external support or guidance. This contradicts the core concept of scaffolding, which is about providing support.\n\n4. **Little League coach** - This is a human providing support and guidance for new learning experiences in sports, similar to a teacher.\n\nThe question asks which is NOT an example of scaffolding. Option 3 (self-study program) is the only one that involves independent learning without external support, which goes against the fundamental concept of scaffolding as described in the passage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\n\nThe passage describes \"omotenashi kōryū nettowāku\" (hospitality exchange networks), which are organizations that connect local people with travelers in cities that travelers visit.\n\nKey points from the passage:\n1. These networks connect local people with travelers in the cities travelers visit\n2. To participate, you usually just fill out an online application, though some networks require additional authentication\n3. Lists of available accommodations are provided in print or online, sometimes with reviews and opinions from other travelers\n4. Couchsurfing is given as an example - it was started in January 2004 by programmer Casey Fenton after he found cheap flights to Iceland but couldn't find accommodation\n5. When Fenton emailed local university students, he received an overwhelming number of offers for free accommodation\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"What is provided to tourists through hospitality exchange networks?\"\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n1. Accommodation provided by local hosts - This matches the passage, which mentions \"available accommodations\" and the Couchsurfing example where local students offered \"free accommodation\"\n2. Cheap airline tickets - This is not what the networks provide; cheap tickets were just mentioned as part of Fenton's personal story\n3. Tours by local guides - This is not mentioned in the passage\n4. Connections with travelers visiting the same destination - The passage emphasizes connecting travelers with LOCAL people, not with other travelers\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that these networks provide accommodation through local hosts, as evidenced by the accommodation lists and the Couchsurfing example.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses different types of tourism:\n\n1. **Recreational tourism** - This is described as the most common form of tourism that most people associate with travel. It involves people going to places completely different from their daily lives to enjoy themselves in a relaxed mood. Examples given are beaches, theme parks, and camping sites.\n\n2. **Cultural tourism** - This is defined as tourism where the purpose of visiting a specific place is to learn about the history or culture of that place. Tourists can either visit various landmarks in a country or choose to focus on just one region.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"What category of tourism would visiting a museum be classified under?\"\n\n**Step 3: Reasoning about museums**\nMuseums are institutions that preserve, display, and educate visitors about history, culture, art, science, and other subjects. When people visit museums, their primary purpose is typically to:\n- Learn about history\n- Understand culture\n- Gain knowledge about specific topics\n- Appreciate cultural artifacts and exhibits\n\n**Step 4: Matching with the tourism types**\nBased on the passage's definition, cultural tourism is when \"the purpose of visiting a specific place is to learn about the history or culture of that place.\" This perfectly matches what people do when they visit museums.\n\nMuseums are not primarily for relaxation or entertainment like beaches or theme parks (recreational tourism), nor are they related to business or outdoor activities.\n\n**Answer: 3**\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about \"re-entry shock\" (再入国ショック) - the shock people experience when returning to their home country after living abroad.\n\nKey points from the passage:\n\n1. Re-entry shock comes faster than culture shock, lasts longer, and can have worse symptoms than culture shock.\n\n2. Even travelers who easily adapted to new cultures abroad may struggle when returning to their home country's specific culture.\n\n3. After living overseas and returning home, people lose familiarity with their home culture habits to the extent that they adapted to the new culture.\n\n4. For first-time overseas travelers, people around them are patient and understanding because they know travelers need time to adjust.\n\n5. However, people may not expect that travelers also need patience and understanding when returning home.\n\nNow, analyzing the question: \"According to the passage content, what type of traveler finds it particularly difficult to endure re-entry shock?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Travelers who experienced particularly bad culture shock\n2. Travelers who quickly adapted during their overseas life\n3. Travelers who are still newlyweds\n4. Travelers with weak patience\n\nThe passage specifically states that \"even travelers who easily adapted to new cultures abroad may struggle when returning to their home country's specific culture\" and \"after living overseas and returning home, people lose familiarity with their home culture habits to the extent that they adapted to the new culture.\"\n\nThis indicates that those who adapted well abroad (quickly adapted) are the ones who particularly struggle with re-entry shock, because they've lost touch with their home culture habits.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses boomerang throwing and provides several key points:\n\n1. Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn\n2. If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that returns to your hand, you should prepare a boomerang that is suitable for returning\n3. Most boomerangs available in Australia actually do not return\n4. Beginners should not throw in windy places\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks which statement accurately describes boomerang throwing according to the passage content.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nOption 1: \"If thrown correctly, it always returns to your hand\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which states that most boomerangs in Australia don't actually return\n\nOption 2: \"It's more popular among local residents than tourists\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which specifically mentions it's popular among tourists who want to learn this skill\n\nOption 3: \"There aren't many boomerangs available in Australia\"\n- This is incorrect. The passage doesn't say boomerangs are scarce, but rather that most of them don't return\n\nOption 4: \"Only some boomerangs can return\"\n- This aligns with the passage, which states you need to \"prepare a boomerang that is suitable for returning\" and that \"most boomerangs available in Australia actually do not return,\" implying only certain types return\n\nThe correct answer matches the passage's explanation that not all boomerangs return - only specific ones designed for that purpose.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what happened in the match described:\n   - South Africa played against New Zealand's All Blacks at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg\n   - South Africa won 21-20, ending the All Blacks' 15-game winning streak\n   - This also ended South Africa's 5-game losing streak\n\n2. Now I need to identify what the question is asking:\n   - The question asks: \"Which teams will play at Ellis Park?\"\n\n3. I need to find information about Ellis Park in the passage:\n   - The passage mentions that the final match of the series will be next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg\n   - It specifically states: \"スプリングボクスがオーストラリアと対戦します\" (Springboks will face Australia)\n\n4. I need to identify the teams correctly:\n   - Springboks = South Africa's rugby team\n   - So the match at Ellis Park will be between South Africa (Springboks) and Australia\n\n5. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: All Blacks and Australia\n   - Option 2: New Zealand and South Africa  \n   - Option 3: South Africa and Australia\n   - Option 4: Springboks and All Blacks\n\nThe passage clearly states that at Ellis Park, the Springboks (South Africa) will play against Australia.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage is about bow markings and techniques for string instruments (likely violin, viola, cello, etc.).\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage explains:\n\n1. Up-bow marks look like a V shape, and down-bow marks look like a staple or a rectangle with the bottom missing.\n\n2. \"Up\" means starting from the tip and pushing the bow, while \"down\" means starting from the frog (where you hold the bow) and pulling the bow.\n\n3. Up-bow usually produces a soft sound, while down-bow produces a stronger, more assertive sound.\n\n4. You can freely write markings with pencil, but printed bow markings have musical reasons and should usually be followed.\n\nNow, let me analyze what relates to \"pulling the bow\" (弓を引く):\n\nFrom the passage, \"down\" (下げ弓/down-bow) is described as \"starting from the frog and pulling the bow\" (フロッグから始めて弓を引く).\n\nSo pulling the bow is associated with:\n- Down-bow technique\n- Starting from the frog\n- Producing stronger, more assertive sounds\n- Markings that look like staples or rectangles with missing bottoms\n\nNow let me check each option:\n\n1. やわらかい音 (soft sound) - This is associated with UP-bow, not down-bow (pulling)\n2. ホチキスの針のようなマーク (staple-like mark) - This IS associated with down-bow (pulling)\n3. より強い音 (stronger sound) - This IS associated with down-bow (pulling)\n4. フロッグからの開始 (starting from the frog) - This IS associated with down-bow (pulling)\n\nThe question asks which is NOT related to pulling the bow. Since pulling the bow refers to down-bow technique, and soft sounds are produced by up-bow (not down-bow), option 1 is not related to pulling the bow.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what the passage is about:\n   - The passage discusses Martelly and a new provisional electoral management committee (CEP)\n   - It mentions that Martelly swore in with a 9-member CEP\n   - This is Martelly's 5th CEP in 4 years\n   - There were protests and issues with elections\n\n2. Now I need to find who proposed the resignation of the previous CEP:\n   - The passage states: \"先月、大統領委員会は、新たな選挙に向けて国を動かすための措置の一環として、前任の欧州委員会の辞任を勧告した\"\n   - This translates to: \"Last month, the presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous commission as part of measures to move the country toward new elections\"\n\n3. Looking at the options:\n   - Option 1: Martelly (マルテリー)\n   - Option 2: Protesters (抗議者)\n   - Option 3: Presidential committee (大統領委員会)\n   - Option 4: CEP members themselves proposed it (CEPのメンバー自身が提案した)\n\n4. The passage clearly states that it was the \"presidential committee\" (大統領委員会) that recommended (勧告した) the resignation of the previous commission.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage describes a disease outbreak and the government's response measures. Let me identify the key information:\n\n1. The disease is carried by pigs and then transmitted to humans through mosquitoes as vectors\n2. The Indian government took several measures in response to the outbreak:\n   - Deployment of pig catchers to severely affected areas\n   - Distribution of thousands of mosquito nets\n   - Spraying of insecticides\n3. Millions of encephalitis vaccines were also promised by the government for next year's preparation\n4. There was a plan to deliver vaccines to historically most affected areas this year, but it was delayed due to insufficient funding and lower priority compared to other diseases\n\nThe question asks: \"Based on the content of the passage, which measure will be implemented last for disease prevention?\"\n\nLooking at the timeline and implementation status:\n- Pig catchers, mosquito nets, and insecticides were already deployed/distributed as immediate response measures\n- The vaccines were promised for \"next year\" and the delivery plan was \"delayed\" due to funding issues and lower priority\n\nThis clearly indicates that the encephalitis vaccines will be implemented last among all the prevention measures mentioned.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses nutrition therapy for athletes. It states that:\n- Nutrition therapy alone cannot create world-class athletes\n- However, nutritional intake can greatly influence young athletes' overall health\n- Maintaining healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding various practical aspects of supplements can help improve athlete performance and promote sports participation\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following is NOT recommended in the passage as a way for young athletes to enjoy sports more?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"Appropriate nutritional intake practice\" - This is directly mentioned in the passage as important for young athletes\n2. \"Maintaining world-class level performance\" - The passage explicitly states that \"nutrition therapy alone cannot create world-class athletes,\" suggesting this is not what's being recommended\n3. \"Effective hydration\" - This is specifically mentioned as beneficial in the passage\n4. \"Maintaining healthy energy balance\" - This is directly stated as helpful in the passage\n\n**Step 4: Identifying what's NOT recommended**\nThe passage mentions three specific recommendations: healthy energy balance, effective hydration, and understanding supplements. It also discusses appropriate nutrition generally. However, it specifically states that nutrition therapy alone doesn't create world-class athletes, which suggests that maintaining world-class performance is not being recommended as a method for young athletes to enjoy sports more.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses transitioning from quarter marathon to half marathon running. It states that:\n- When moving from quarter marathon to half marathon, the importance of speed becomes much lower\n- Endurance becomes absolutely necessary\n- While elite half marathon runners who break 2 minutes should have decent speed, they must develop endurance no matter what\n- Cross-country running in winter combined with upper body training at the gym provides the best preparation for running season\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the content in the text, what is the most important thing for elite half marathon runners?\"\n\n**Step 3: Examining each option**\n1. Doing cross-country running in winter - This is mentioned as good preparation, but not as the most important thing\n2. Building endurance rather than speed - This aligns with the passage's emphasis that \"endurance becomes absolutely necessary\" and speed importance \"becomes much lower\"\n3. Achieving times under 2 minutes - This is mentioned as a characteristic of elite runners, but not as what's most important for them\n4. Increasing speed rather than endurance - This directly contradicts the passage, which states speed becomes less important\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the correct answer**\nThe passage clearly emphasizes that when transitioning to half marathon, endurance becomes \"absolutely necessary\" while speed becomes \"much lower\" in importance. Even for elite runners, the text states they \"must develop endurance no matter what.\"\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the \"protein problem\"**\nThe passage explains that for primates with human-like digestive systems, it's difficult to obtain essential amino acids from plant resources available in savanna environments. Failure to get these nutrients leads to serious consequences including growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing plant-based options**\nThe passage states that the most accessible plant resources are proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing animal-based options**\nThe passage mentions that animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are:\n- Easy to digest\n- High-quality protein sources containing all essential amino acids\n\n**Step 4: The solution mentioned**\nThe passage concludes that our ancestors likely solved the \"protein problem\" the same way modern savanna-dwelling chimpanzees do.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the options**\n1. 枯れ葉 (dried leaves) - This would be plant-based and difficult to digest\n2. 生の豆類 (raw legumes) - The passage specifically mentions these are hard to digest without cooking\n3. バッタ類 (grasshoppers/locusts) - These are insects, similar to the ants and termites mentioned as good animal protein sources\n4. 花の茎 (flower stems) - This would be plant-based material, likely difficult to digest\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the passage's emphasis on animal foods (insects like ants and termites) being the solution to the protein problem, and the fact that grasshoppers/locusts are insects that would provide similar benefits, option 3 is the correct answer.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The passage discusses long-distance phone calls that automatically go through satellites when calling someone thousands of miles away\n   - Artificial satellites in space receive these calls and reflect them almost instantly\n   - Satellites were sent to space by rockets\n   - Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and scenery that enters human vision\n   - To launch satellites and telescopes into space, giant rockets over 100 feet tall are needed first\n\n2. **Understanding the question:**\n   The question asks: \"Which of the following reflects long-distance phone calls to Earth?\"\n\n3. **Analyzing each option:**\n   - Option 1 (望遠鏡 - telescope): The passage mentions telescopes are used for observation purposes to avoid atmospheric distortion, not for phone calls\n   - Option 2 (人工衛星 - artificial satellite): The passage clearly states that satellites receive phone calls and reflect them almost instantly\n   - Option 3 (光 - light): Light is mentioned in relation to telescopes and vision, not phone calls\n   - Option 4 (ロケット - rocket): Rockets are used to launch satellites and telescopes into space, but don't handle phone calls themselves\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The passage explicitly states that artificial satellites receive long-distance phone calls and reflect them almost instantly. This directly answers the question about what reflects long-distance phone calls to Earth.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses gravity on Io (one of Jupiter's moons). It states:\n- If you stood on Io's surface, your weight would be less than on Earth\n- A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io\n- Naturally, gravity becomes lighter\n\n**Step 2: Understanding what this means about gravity**\nSince weight = mass × gravity, and mass stays constant, the reduction in weight from 200 pounds to 36 pounds means that Io's gravity is much weaker than Earth's gravity.\n\nThe ratio is: 36/200 = 0.18, meaning Io's gravity is about 18% of Earth's gravity.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"Earth's gravity is less than Io's gravity\" - This is incorrect. Earth's gravity is stronger.\n\n2. \"Io's gravity is stronger, so weight becomes lighter\" - This is contradictory and incorrect. Stronger gravity would make weight heavier, not lighter.\n\n3. \"Io's gravity is stronger, so weight becomes heavier\" - This contradicts the passage, which clearly states weight becomes lighter on Io.\n\n4. \"Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's gravity\" - This is correct. Since people weigh less on Io, Earth must have stronger gravity.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly indicates that Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's gravity, which is why people would weigh less on Io.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: This passage describes an incident involving a photographer who was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and later died. The person was in their 20s, and Justin Bieber made a statement about the tragic accident.\n\n2. **Key information about what happened**: According to TMZ, the photographer had parked their car in the opposite lane of Sepulveda Boulevard and was trying to cross the road.\n\n3. **The photographer's intention**: The passage specifically states that the photographer was trying to \"写真に収めようとした\" (trying to capture in photos) the \"警察の検問\" (police checkpoint/inspection).\n\n4. **Police warnings**: California Highway Patrol officers who were controlling traffic had ordered the photographer twice to cross back, but the photographer was attempting to photograph the police checkpoint before crossing back.\n\n5. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - Option 1: \"Stop a car on Sepulveda Boulevard\" - This was something that already happened, not what they were trying to do before being hit\n   - Option 2: \"Capture photos of the police checkpoint\" - This matches exactly what the passage states\n   - Option 3: \"Cross a busy street\" - This was part of the action but not the main purpose\n   - Option 4: \"Persuade police officers to let them continue taking photos\" - This is not mentioned in the passage\n\nThe passage clearly states that the photographer was trying to photograph the police checkpoint (\"警察の検問を写真に収めようとした\") before the accident occurred.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya issued a warning\n   - \"Somali extremists\" are planning suicide bombings in Kenya and Ethiopia\n   - The US received information from undisclosed sources about the use of suicide bombings to blow up \"prominent landmarks\" in Ethiopia and Kenya\n\n2. **Key details from the passage:**\n   - Two countries are mentioned: Kenya and Ethiopia (2カ国)\n   - The targets are specifically \"prominent landmarks\" (著名なランドマーク)\n   - The method is suicide bombings/explosions (自爆テロ/爆弾)\n\n3. **Analyzing each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"Exploding bombs at landmarks in one country\" - This mentions only one country, but the passage clearly states two countries (Kenya and Ethiopia)\n   - Option 2: \"Exploding bombs in two countries\" - This mentions two countries but doesn't specify that the targets are landmarks\n   - Option 3: \"Exploding bombs at landmarks in two countries\" - This mentions both two countries AND landmarks as targets\n   - Option 4: \"Exploding bombs in one country\" - This mentions only one country and doesn't specify landmarks\n\n4. **Matching with the passage:**\n   The passage clearly states that extremists plan to target \"prominent landmarks\" (著名なランドマーク) in both Kenya and Ethiopia (two countries). Option 3 is the only one that accurately captures both elements: the two countries and the specific targeting of landmarks.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage describes Kirby Muxloe Castle as a typical castle of its era. Key points:\n- It had more of an atmosphere of a fortified mansion rather than a castle\n- It had large glass windows and thin walls\n- These features meant it could not withstand prolonged, determined attacks\n- Construction began in the 1480s by Lord Hastings\n- The country was relatively peaceful at that time\n- Defense was only needed against small groups of wandering raiders\n\n**Question:** Which is an accurate description of Kirby Muxloe Castle?\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\n1. \"The castle's thick walls were at Lord Hastings' request\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which states the castle had \"thin walls\" (薄い壁)\n\n2. \"The era when it was built had characteristics of a peace-loving country, so only minimal fortification was necessary\"\n- This aligns with the passage: the country was \"relatively peaceful\" and only needed defense against \"small groups of wandering raiders\"\n\n3. \"This castle's structure was not common for that era\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which explicitly states it was \"typical of this era\" (この時代の典型的な城)\n\n4. \"It was built to withstand prolonged intense attacks\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which states it \"could not withstand prolonged, determined attacks\"\n\nThe correct answer describes the peaceful nature of the era requiring only minimal fortification, which matches the passage's description of the relatively peaceful country needing only defense against small raiding groups.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the main content**: The passage discusses the Komen Foundation's new policy regarding funding organizations under legal investigation.\n\n2. **Identifying key information**: \n   - Leslie Aoun, a spokesperson for the Komen Foundation, states that the foundation has adopted a new rule not to provide grants or funding to organizations under legal investigation.\n   - This policy makes the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (米国家族計画連盟) ineligible due to an ongoing investigation.\n\n3. **Understanding the investigation**:\n   - Congressman Cliff Stearns is conducting an investigation into Planned Parenthood's fund usage and reporting methods.\n   - Stearns is the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee under the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n   - He is investigating whether tax money is being used for abortion funding through Planned Parenthood.\n\n4. **Answering the question**: The question asks \"Which organization is under legal investigation?\"\n\n5. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - Option 1: Energy and Commerce Committee - This is the committee conducting the investigation, not being investigated\n   - Option 2: Komen Foundation - This foundation created the new policy but is not under investigation\n   - Option 3: Planned Parenthood Federation (家族計画連盟) - This is explicitly stated as being under investigation by Congressman Stearns\n   - Option 4: Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee - This is the subcommittee conducting the investigation, not being investigated\n\nThe passage clearly states that Planned Parenthood Federation of America is under investigation regarding its fund usage and reporting methods.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is discussing:\n- The passage is about Triceratops' diet and what parts of cycad plants they might have eaten\n- It mentions that Triceratops teeth could crush not only leaves but also hard branches and roots\n- Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycad plants that were abundant in the Cretaceous period\n- These plants had sharp, pointed crown-like leaves and looked like palm-like shrubs\n- The passage mentions that Triceratops might have stripped off leaves with their strong beaks before eating the trunk\n- Other scientists argue that these plants were highly toxic, making it unlikely that dinosaurs ate them\n\nNow, analyzing the question: \"According to the passage content, which part of the cycad was Triceratops most likely to have eaten?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. Sharp pointed leaves - The passage mentions that Triceratops would strip off the leaves with their beaks, but this seems to be removing them rather than eating them.\n\n2. Trunk/stem - The passage specifically states \"トリケラトプスは木の幹を食べる前に、その強靭なくちばしで葉をはぎ取っていた可能性があります\" (Triceratops possibly stripped off leaves with their strong beaks before eating the trunk).\n\n3. Roots - While mentioned as something their teeth could crush, roots are not specifically mentioned as what they ate from cycads.\n\n4. Fruit - Not mentioned in the context of what Triceratops ate from cycads.\n\nThe key sentence indicates that Triceratops would remove the leaves first and then eat the trunk/stem. This clearly suggests the trunk was the part they consumed.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage is about Goma, a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Let me break down the key information:\n\n1. Goma is located in the far east of DRC, near Rwanda\n2. In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo volcano, burying most streets, especially in the city center\n3. Goma is fairly safe, but visitors should research the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province if traveling outside Goma\n4. The city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano\n5. It's one of the cheapest places in Africa to track mountain gorillas\n6. Transportation within Goma can be done using boda-boda (motorcycle taxis), with typical local rates around 500 Congolese francs for short distances\n\nNow let me examine each option to find which one is NOT good advice for tourists:\n\nOption 1: \"The fighting in North Kivu is interesting\" - This suggests that conflict/fighting is interesting, which would be dangerous and inappropriate advice for tourists.\n\nOption 2: \"It's a good place for low-cost mountain gorilla tracking\" - This matches the passage's statement that it's one of the cheapest places in Africa for this activity.\n\nOption 3: \"Motorcycle taxis are a good means of getting around\" - This aligns with the passage's information about using boda-boda for transportation.\n\nOption 4: \"The base for Nyiragongo volcano is in the city\" - This matches the passage's statement that the city serves as a base for climbing the volcano.\n\nOption 1 is clearly bad advice as it encourages tourists to be interested in dangerous conflict situations, which contradicts the passage's warning about needing to research and understand the fighting situation for safety reasons.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this Japanese passage step by step.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses methods for traveling cheaply, whether out of necessity, lifestyle choice, or for the challenge. It mentions two main approaches:\n1. Working while traveling\n2. Reducing expenses (which the article focuses on)\n\nThe key sentence states: \"快適さ、時間、予測可能性を犠牲にして出費をゼロに近づけたい方は、最低予算で旅行する方法をご覧ください。\"\n\nThis translates to: \"For those who want to bring expenses close to zero by sacrificing comfort, time, and predictability, please see how to travel on a minimum budget.\"\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the content in the text, what kind of person would struggle with traveling on an extremely small budget?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. People who challenge difficulties - The passage suggests budget travel is for those seeking challenges, so they wouldn't struggle\n2. People without strict time constraints - These people would actually be better suited for budget travel since they can sacrifice time\n3. People planning to do remote work while traveling - The passage mentions working while traveling as one of the two main approaches, so this wouldn't be a struggle\n4. People who enjoy following itineraries - This relates to \"predictability\" (予測可能性) mentioned in the passage\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe passage explicitly states that ultra-budget travel requires sacrificing \"comfort, time, and predictability.\" People who enjoy following itineraries value predictability and structured plans. Since budget travel requires giving up predictability, these people would struggle the most with extremely low-budget travel.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland compared to French spoken in France. Key points:\n\n1. French in Belgium and Switzerland is slightly different from French in France, but similar enough for mutual understanding\n2. The numbering systems in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland show some special characteristics that differ from French spoken in France\n3. Some word pronunciations are also subtly different\n4. However, French-speaking Belgians and Swiss all learned standard French in school, so they should understand even if standard French numbering system is used\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following is different in France compared to Belgium and Switzerland?\"\n\n**Examining each option:**\n\n1. \"All word pronunciations\" - The passage says \"some word pronunciations are subtly different\" (一部の単語の発音も微妙に異なっています), not ALL pronunciations are different.\n\n2. \"Numbering system\" - The passage explicitly states that the numbering systems in Belgium and Switzerland differ from those in France (番号体系は、フランスで話されているフランス語とは異なる).\n\n3. \"Standard French taught in school\" - The passage indicates that Belgians and Swiss learn the same standard French in school, so this would be the same, not different.\n\n4. \"Spelling of some French words\" - The passage doesn't mention anything about spelling differences.\n\nThe passage clearly identifies numbering systems as a specific difference between France and Belgium/Switzerland.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I need to understand what the passage is saying about seismic activity and phase changes.\n\n2. The passage mentions:\n   - No earthquakes were recorded in Iceland the previous week according to the US Geological Survey\n   - Iceland's meteorological agency reported no seismic activity in the Hekla region in the past 48 hours\n   - Major seismic activity leading to phase change occurred on March 10th on the northeast side of the volcano's summit caldera\n   - Dark clouds unrelated to volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain\n\n3. The question asks: \"According to the content in the text, when did the phase change occur?\"\n\n4. Looking at the key sentence: \"相変化につながる大きな地震活動は、3月10日に火山の山頂カルデラの北東側で発生していました\" (Major seismic activity leading to phase change occurred on March 10th on the northeast side of the volcano's summit caldera)\n\n5. This sentence clearly states that the major seismic activity that led to the phase change occurred on March 10th.\n\n6. The question is asking when the phase change occurred, and the passage indicates it was the result of seismic activity that happened on March 10th.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses the concept of time as something that is familiar yet difficult to understand. It mentions that:\n- Time has been studied by religious figures, philosophers, and scientists for thousands of years\n- We experience time as a series of events from future through present to past\n- Time is also a way to compare the duration (length) of events\n- By observing the repetition of periodic events, we can mark the passage of time ourselves\n- Periodic events are defined as things that occur regularly and repeatedly\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"When tracking the passage of time, what should we pay attention to regarding periodic events?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. 継続時間 (duration/length of time)\n2. 繰り返し (repetition)\n3. 影響 (influence/impact)\n4. 障害 (obstacles/barriers)\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe passage specifically states that we can mark the passage of time by \"observing the repetition of periodic events\" (周期的な出来事の繰り返しを観察することで). It then defines periodic events as things that \"occur regularly and repeatedly\" (何度も定期的に発生すること).\n\nThe key concept emphasized is that periodic events are useful for tracking time precisely because of their repetitive nature. The passage highlights \"repetition\" (繰り返し) as the essential characteristic that makes periodic events useful for measuring time's passage.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses a leaked document about negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Let me identify what issues ARE mentioned in the document:\n\n1. **Border disputes** - The passage explicitly states \"当該文書は国境紛争に言及するもので\" (the document refers to border disputes)\n\n2. **Jerusalem's future** - The passage mentions \"エルサレムの未来国家...の問題が扱われている\" (issues regarding Jerusalem's future state are being addressed)\n\n3. **Military presence in the valley** - The passage discusses \"ヨルダン渓谷の問題\" (Jordan Valley issues) and specifically mentions Israel's demand for \"10年間にわたる峡谷での駐留継続\" (continued military presence in the valley for 10 years) while Palestine agrees to only 5 years\n\n4. **1967 war causes** - The passage mentions \"1967年の中東戦争前の国境\" (borders before the 1967 Middle East War) as Palestine's desired reference point, but it does NOT discuss the causes of the 1967 war itself.\n\nNow checking each option:\n1. Jerusalem's future - This IS mentioned in the document\n2. Causes of the 1967 war - This is NOT mentioned in the document\n3. Military presence in the valley - This IS mentioned in the document  \n4. Border disputes - This IS mentioned in the document\n\nThe question asks which issue is NOT included in the document.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses political events involving Martelley and a new provisional electoral management committee (CEP). Key points:\n\n1. Yesterday, Martelley was sworn in with a new 9-member provisional electoral management committee (CEP)\n2. This is Martelley's 5th CEP in 4 years\n3. Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous commission as part of measures to move the country toward new elections\n4. This committee was a countermeasure by President Martelley against widespread anti-government protests that began in October\n5. These sometimes violent protests were triggered by scheduled elections that were not held, occurring since 2011\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks which statement about the protest actions is NOT correct.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nOption 1: \"The presidential committee was a countermeasure against the protest actions\"\n- The passage states the committee was Martelley's countermeasure against the protests - this is CORRECT\n\nOption 2: \"Long-postponed elections triggered the protest actions\"\n- The passage states protests were triggered by scheduled elections that were not implemented - this is CORRECT\n\nOption 3: \"The protest actions demanded the resignation of the previous CEP\"\n- The passage says the presidential committee recommended the previous commission's resignation, but doesn't say the protests specifically demanded CEP resignation - this appears INCORRECT\n\nOption 4: \"The protest actions were sometimes violent\"\n- The passage explicitly states the protests were \"sometimes violent\" - this is CORRECT\n\nThe question asks for the incorrect statement. Option 3 makes a claim not supported by the passage text.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - Johnny Reid, co-driver of the A1GP New Zealand team, drove across Auckland Harbour Bridge\n   - He drove a car called \"Black Beauty\" at speeds over 160 km/h\n   - He crossed the bridge 7 times\n   - The New Zealand police had difficulty measuring his speed with their speed measurement devices\n\n2. **Key information about speed measurement:**\n   - The passage states that police had trouble confirming Reid's speed because \"Black Beauty's\" speed was low (this seems to be a translation issue - it likely means the speed was too high for their equipment)\n   - The crucial sentence says: \"警察がリード氏の速度を確認できたのは、時速160 kmまで減速したときだけだったそうです\" \n   - This translates to: \"Police were only able to confirm Reid's speed when he decelerated to 160 km/h\"\n\n3. **Analyzing the question:**\n   - The question asks: \"When were the police able to use measurement devices to measure Johnny Reid's driving speed?\"\n\n4. **Evaluating the options:**\n   - Option 1: \"When he was driving at 160 km/h\" - This matches the passage\n   - Option 2: \"When he crossed the bridge for the 7th time\" - No specific mention of this timing\n   - Option 3: \"When he was driving at over 160 km/h\" - The passage says they couldn't measure at these higher speeds\n   - Option 4: \"When he first crossed the bridge\" - No specific mention of this timing\n\nThe passage clearly states that police could only confirm his speed when he decelerated to 160 km/h, not when he was going faster.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\n\nThe passage explains that curry is a dish made by simmering meat and vegetables with herbs and spices as a base. It mentions that curry is classified as either \"dry\" or \"wet\" depending on moisture content. Then it provides key regional information: in North India and inland Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry, while in South India and coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.\n\nNow, let me analyze the question:\nThe question asks: \"In certain regions, coconut milk is used as a substitute for which ingredient in curry?\"\n\nLooking at the passage, it establishes a clear contrast between two regional practices:\n- North India/inland Pakistan: commonly use yogurt\n- South India/coastal areas: commonly use coconut milk\n\nThis suggests that coconut milk and yogurt serve similar functions in curry preparation but are used in different regions. The passage presents them as regional alternatives to each other.\n\nThe other ingredients mentioned (meat, vegetables, spices) are described as fundamental components of curry in general, not as regionally variable ingredients that would be substituted.\n\nTherefore, coconut milk is used as a substitute for yogurt in certain regions.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the geographical context**\nThe passage describes a region that borders the Sahel to the north and is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west. This appears to be describing West Africa.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the advice given to female travelers**\nThe passage provides several pieces of advice for women traveling to this region:\n\n1. Women should claim to be married regardless of their actual marital status\n2. Wearing a ring (not too expensive-looking) is effective\n3. Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what might be called harassment\n4. Being followed or having one's arm grabbed is not uncommon\n5. When refusing men's advances, women should maintain a firm and resolute attitude without hesitation\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating each option against the passage content**\n\nOption 1: \"Recognize that being followed is a rare occurrence\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which states that being followed is \"not uncommon\" (珍しくありません)\n\nOption 2: \"Wear a large ring showing you are married\"\n- The passage recommends wearing a ring, but specifically mentions it should NOT look too expensive (あまり高そうでないもの)\n\nOption 3: \"Understand that cultural differences suggest avoiding maintaining your position\"\n- This contradicts the passage, which advises women to \"maintain their position resolutely\" (毅然とした態度で自分の立場を貫きましょう)\n\nOption 4: \"In case of unwanted advances, firmly reject men\"\n- This directly matches the passage's advice to \"maintain a resolute attitude and stick to your position\" when refusing men's invitations\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption 4 accurately reflects the advice given in the passage about firmly rejecting unwanted advances from men.\n\n4",

July 4: Document adopted by Congress, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson\n2. The handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away\n3. 150-200 copies were made overnight (these became known as \"Dunlap Broadsides\")\n4. July 8: First public reading by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall\n5. July 6: One copy was sent to George Washington\n6. July 9: Read to troops in New York\n7.

It also mentions a popular summer dish called \"pan boli\" which consists of bread with olive oil, tomatoes, cheese, and seasonings like tuna.\n\nNow, let me examine what the question is asking:\nThe question asks: \"According to the content in the text, which of these is NOT a main ingredient in Majorcan cuisine?\"\n\nLet me check each option against what's mentioned in the passage:\n\n1. 肉 (meat) - The passage explicitly states that meat, especially pork, is a main ingredient\n2. パン (bread) - The passage explicitly states that bread is a main ingredient\n3. 穀物 (grains/cereals) - This is NOT specifically mentioned as a main ingredient in the passage\n4. 野菜 (vegetables) - The passage explicitly states that vegetables are a main ingredient\n\nThe passage specifically mentions bread, vegetables, and meat as the main ingredients. While bread is made from grains, the passage does not specifically mention \"grains\" or \"cereals\" (穀物) as a main ingredient category.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage explains that avalanches are not abnormal phenomena. There's a limit to how much snow can be supported on steep slopes, and excess amounts fall as avalanches. The problem is that snow has adhesive properties, so it needs some kind of trigger to fall, and part of the falling snow can become a trigger for the remaining snow to fall. The original triggering events can be snow melting due to solar heat, increased snowfall, other natural phenomena, or often human factors.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following can be a trigger for avalanches?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. 粘着性がある雪 (Snow with adhesive properties) - The passage states that snow's adhesive properties are why triggers are needed, but adhesiveness itself is not a trigger.\n\n2. 人間 (Humans) - The passage mentions \"人為的な要因\" (human factors) as potential triggers.\n\n3. 日光 (Sunlight) - The passage mentions \"太陽の熱による雪解け\" (snow melting due to solar heat) as a trigger.\n\n4. 追加の降雪 (Additional snowfall) - The passage mentions \"降雪量の増加\" (increased snowfall) as a trigger.\n\nThe question asks which one can be a trigger, and options 2, 3, and 4 are all mentioned in the passage as potential triggers. However, looking at the specific wording, the passage most directly mentions solar heat (which relates to sunlight), increased snowfall, and human factors as triggers.\n\nSince all three (2, 3, 4) are valid according to the passage, I need to consider which is most directly stated. The passage specifically mentions \"太陽の熱\" (solar heat), which directly relates to sunlight/日光.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what the passage says about Homer:\nThe passage mentions that Homer was a \"legendary blind poet\" (伝説の盲目詩人ホメロス) who composed the two great masterpieces of Greek literature, the Iliad and the Odyssey.\n\nThe key information here is that Homer is described as \"blind\" (盲目).\n\nNow I'll examine what the question is asking:\nThe question asks \"What could the Greek poet Homer not do?\" (ギリシャの詩人ホメロスは何ができなかったでしょう?)\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. 聞くこと (hearing/listening)\n2. 見ること (seeing)\n3. 歩くこと (walking)\n4. しゃべること (speaking/talking)\n\nSince the passage specifically states that Homer was blind (盲目), this means he could not see. Being blind refers to the inability to see or having no vision.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention any problems with his hearing, walking ability, or speaking ability. In fact, since he was a poet who composed great works, he would have needed to be able to speak/recite his poetry.\n\nTherefore, based on the description of Homer as a \"blind poet,\" the thing he could not do was see.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage discusses airlines like Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, and Turkish Airlines that are expanding their routes to Africa and offering competitive connecting flights to major African cities. It mentions that Turkish Airlines serves 39 cities in 30 African countries as of 2014.\n\nThe key part for answering the question is in the last two sentences:\n1. \"When travel time becomes longer, check how the total fare estimate to Africa compares with round-the-world fares.\"\n2. \"When visiting places other than Africa, don't forget additional costs such as additional visa applications, departure taxes, and ground transportation costs.\"\n\nThe question asks: \"When comparing the total Africa travel fare estimate with round-the-world fares, what do you NOT need to add?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. Additional visa costs for places other than Africa - The passage mentions this as an additional cost when visiting non-African places\n2. Africa departure tax costs - This would be a cost within Africa itself\n3. Africa visa costs - This would be a necessary cost for traveling to Africa\n4. Ground transportation costs for places other than Africa - The passage mentions this as an additional cost when visiting non-African places\n\nThe passage specifically states that additional visa applications, departure taxes, and ground transportation costs should not be forgotten when visiting places OTHER than Africa. This implies these are extra costs beyond the basic Africa trip comparison.\n\nHowever, when comparing Africa travel costs with round-the-world fares, you would need to include Africa-specific costs (like Africa visas and Africa departure taxes) in both scenarios. The costs that you would NOT need to add are those related to non-African destinations, since we're specifically comparing Africa travel costs.\n\nBut looking more carefully, the question is asking what you DON'T need to add when making this comparison. Africa visa costs would be necessary for any Africa trip, so this would be included in the base comparison. The additional costs mentioned in the passage (options 1 and 4) are specifically for non-African places, which wouldn't be relevant to a pure Africa vs. round-the-world fare comparison.\n\nAmong the options, \"Africa visa costs\" (option 3) would be a standard, necessary cost that's already factored into any Africa travel estimate, so it wouldn't need to be \"added\" as an extra cost.\n\n3",

Let me identify what he mentioned:\n\n1. He stated China would strive to significantly reduce CO2 emissions per GDP from 2005 levels by 2020\n2. He did not specify exact numerical targets for the reduction\n3. He mentioned the reduction would be implemented based on China's economic output\n4. He called on developing countries to avoid the previous approach of \"pollute first, clean up later\"\n5. He added that developing countries should not be asked to take on obligations beyond their development stage, responsibility, and capacity\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following did Hu Jintao NOT mention?\"\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n1. **削減の基準 (Reduction criteria/standards)** - He DID mention this: reductions based on economic output and per GDP\n2. **汚染に関する発展途上国への助言 (Advice to developing countries regarding pollution)** - He DID mention this: advised avoiding \"pollute first, clean up later\"\n3. **二酸化炭素排出量の削減を期待する期日 (Expected deadline for CO2 emission reduction)** - He DID mention this: by 2020\n4. **二酸化炭素排出量削減の数値 (Numerical values for CO2 emission reduction)** - He did NOT mention this: the passage explicitly states \"胡氏は、削減する数値を定めませんでした\" (Hu did not specify numerical values for reduction)\n\nThe passage clearly states that Hu Jintao did not define specific numerical targets for the reduction.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\nThe passage describes Babylonian religious practices and temple structure:\n\n1. Babylonians built primary temples for each god, considered as the gods' houses\n2. People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to fulfill the gods' wishes through rituals and festivals\n3. Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter\n4. Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples\n5. The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods\n\nNow let me examine each option to determine where ordinary Babylonian citizens would NOT be seen:\n\nOption 1: \"A place where sacrifices are offered in the temple courtyard\"\n- The passage states people offered sacrifices to gods, and mentions an \"open courtyard\" - this suggests ordinary citizens could access the courtyard for sacrifices.\n\nOption 2: \"A place where rituals are performed in the primary temple\"\n- The passage mentions that priests performed rituals, but doesn't explicitly restrict ordinary people from all ritual areas in the temple.\n\nOption 3: \"A place for festivals in the temple courtyard\"\n- The passage mentions festivals and an \"open courtyard,\" suggesting ordinary people could participate in courtyard festivals.\n\nOption 4: \"A place where sacrifices are offered in the inner sanctuary\"\n- The passage clearly states that the inner sanctuary (内宮) could only be entered by priests (神官のみが入れる). This would be the place where ordinary citizens would not be seen.\n\nThe key distinction is that the inner sanctuary was restricted to priests only, while the courtyard was described as \"open.\"\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses light bulbs and their replacement. It explains:\n- After hundreds of hours of use, the filament inside the bulb eventually burns out and the bulb stops lighting\n- This necessitates bulb replacement\n- When replacing bulbs, caution is needed\n- First, you must turn off the lighting fixture switch or disconnect the cable\n- This is because when part of the bulb is in the socket, touching the socket or metal parts of the bulb can cause severe electric shock due to current flowing through the socket that the bulb's metal parts are in contact with\n\n**Step 2: Identifying what causes the bulb to stop lighting**\nThe passage clearly states in the first sentence: \"After hundreds of hours of use, the filament inside the bulb eventually burns out and the bulb stops lighting.\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the content in the text, what is the cause of the light bulb not lighting up?\"\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n1. The lighting fixture switch not being turned off properly - This is mentioned as a safety concern during replacement, not a cause of bulb failure\n2. The metal base of the bulb being only partially in the socket - This is mentioned as a safety hazard during replacement, not a cause of failure\n3. The filament inside the bulb burning out - This directly matches what the passage states as the cause\n4. The speed of current flowing to the socket decreasing - This is not mentioned in the passage\n\n**Step 5: Selecting the correct answer**\nOption 3 directly corresponds to the cause stated in the passage: the filament burns out after extended use.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage describes dress code requirements when visiting monasteries:\n- Women must wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered\n- Most monasteries provide coverings for unprepared women visitors\n- Bringing bright-colored coverings may earn smiles from monks/nuns\n- Men must wear pants that cover their knees\n- Pants can be borrowed at the reception, but they're not washed between users\n- The men's pants are one-size-fits-all\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing what can be borrowed**\nFrom the passage, I can identify what the monastery provides:\n- Coverings/wraps for women (覆い) - mentioned as available\n- Pants for men (ズボン) - explicitly mentioned as borrowable at reception\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question and options**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following clothing items is unlikely to be borrowed at the monastery?\"\n\nOptions:\n1. スカート (Skirt)\n2. 短パン (Shorts) \n3. ズボン (Pants)\n4. 布 (Cloth/fabric)\n\n**Step 4: Elimination process**\n- Option 3 (ズボン/Pants): The passage explicitly states these can be borrowed\n- Option 4 (布/Cloth): This likely refers to the coverings (覆い) mentioned for women\n- Option 1 (スカート/Skirt): While not explicitly mentioned, skirts would serve the same purpose as the coverings for women\n- Option 2 (短パン/Shorts): These are short pants that don't cover the knees, which would violate the dress code requirement\n\n**Step 5: Logical conclusion**\nShorts (短パン) would be counterproductive to lend out since they don't meet the monastery's requirement of covering the knees. It would make no sense for a monastery to provide clothing that violates their own dress code.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage content:**\n   - The match kicked off at 10 AM\n   - Morning drizzle cleared up, making it perfect weather for 7s rugby\n   - South Africa (top seed) defeated Zambia (5th seed) 26-0, showing a good start\n   - In the match against their southern sister nation, South Africa appeared rusty\n   - However, South Africa steadily improved as the tournament progressed\n   - Their disciplined defense, ball handling skills, and excellent teamwork were outstanding\n   - It was clear this team was the winner\n\n2. **Analyzing the question:**\n   The question asks: \"According to the passage content, when did South Africa's matches start to improve?\"\n\n3. **Examining each option:**\n   - Option 1: \"Around 10:00 AM\" - This refers to the kickoff time, not when improvement began\n   - Option 2: \"After tightening their defense\" - The passage mentions disciplined defense as a strength, but doesn't say improvement came after tightening defense\n   - Option 3: \"After losing to Zambia\" - This is incorrect; South Africa won against Zambia 26-0\n   - Option 4: \"As the tournament progressed\" - This directly matches the passage which states \"南アフリカは大会が進むにつれて着実に調子を上げていきました\" (South Africa steadily improved as the tournament progressed)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The passage explicitly states that South Africa steadily improved as the tournament progressed, which directly corresponds to option 4.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses 20th-century research on genetic variation. It explains that there are two genetic pools:\n- Hidden genetic variations\n- Expressed genetic variations\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the key processes mentioned**\nThe passage describes several processes:\n1. Mutation (突然変異) - adds new genetic variations\n2. Selection (淘汰) - removes variations from the expressed variation pool\n3. Segregation/separation (棲み分け) and recombination (組み換え) - shuffle variations between the two pools across generations\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"Which process is a factor in the addition of genetic variations?\"\n\n**Step 4: Examining each option**\n1. 分離 (Segregation) - The passage mentions this shuffles variations between pools, but doesn't add new ones\n2. 組み換え (Recombination) - The passage states this shuffles existing variations, not adding new ones\n3. 突然変異 (Mutation) - The passage explicitly states \"突然変異で新しい遺伝的変異が加わり\" (new genetic variations are added through mutation)\n4. 発現 (Expression) - This refers to variations being expressed, not added\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly states that mutation is the process that adds new genetic variations to the gene pool.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Passage Analysis:**\nThe passage is about Bobek, a football player born in Zagreb, Croatia. Here are the key facts:\n\n1. Bobek was born in Zagreb, Croatia\n2. He became famous while playing for Partizan Belgrade\n3. He joined Partizan in 1945\n4. He stayed with Partizan until 1958\n5. During his time there, he played 468 matches and scored 403 goals\n6. No other player at this club has achieved as many appearances or goals as Bobek\n7. In 1995, he was selected as the greatest player in Partizan's history\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks which statement about Bobek's career at Partizan Belgrade is correct.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nOption 1: \"He debuted at Partizan in 1945\"\n- The passage states he \"joined them in 1945\" (1945年に彼らと合流し)\n- This is correct.\n\nOption 2: \"He was active in Zagreb before Partizan Belgrade\"\n- The passage only mentions he was born in Zagreb, not that he played there professionally\n- This cannot be confirmed from the passage.\n\nOption 3: \"He was active at Partizan until 1995\"\n- The passage states he stayed until 1958 (1958年まで滞在した)\n- 1995 is when he was named the greatest player, not when he stopped playing\n- This is incorrect.\n\nOption 4: \"He became famous after being selected as Partizan's greatest player\"\n- The passage states he became famous while playing for Partizan, and was selected as greatest player in 1995\n- Since he played from 1945-1958, he became famous long before 1995\n- This is incorrect.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses how children develop awareness of race and racial stereotypes from a very early age, and how these racial stereotypes influence their behavior. It provides a specific example: when children who identify with minority races that are subject to negative stereotypes don't do well in school, and then become aware of the stereotypes about their race, they tend to perform even worse in school.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the content in the passage, children's racial stereotypes have the potential to influence which of the following?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"The minority race they decide they belong to\" - The passage doesn't suggest that stereotypes influence which race children identify with.\n\n2. \"Their own behavior\" - The passage explicitly states that \"these racial stereotypes influence behavior\" (こうした人種の固定観念が行動に影響を与えます) and gives a concrete example of how awareness of stereotypes affects academic performance.\n\n3. \"Relationships with other children\" - While this might be a logical consequence, the passage doesn't specifically mention relationships with other children.\n\n4. \"The definition of race\" - The passage doesn't discuss how children's stereotypes might change the definition of race itself.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the correct answer**\nThe passage directly states that racial stereotypes influence behavior, and provides a specific example of this influence on academic performance. This clearly corresponds to option 2.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage**\nThe passage states: \"This is eBay's largest acquisition in history. The company wants to diversify its revenue sources and gain popularity in regions where Skype is dominant, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\"\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"What is eBay trying to achieve with this acquisition?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing what eBay wants to accomplish**\nFrom the passage, eBay has two main goals:\n1. Diversify revenue sources (収益源を多様化)\n2. Gain popularity in regions where Skype is dominant (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil)\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n1. \"Consolidate revenue\" (収益を集約する) - This is the opposite of what's stated. eBay wants to diversify, not consolidate.\n\n2. \"Expand into new territories/domains\" (新しい領域へ展開する) - This matches perfectly. eBay is expanding into new geographical regions (China, Eastern Europe, Brazil) and diversifying revenue sources implies expanding into new business areas.\n\n3. \"Increase attention/recognition\" (注目度を上げる) - While gaining popularity is mentioned, this is more about market presence than just attention.\n\n4. \"Satisfy shareholders\" (株主を満足させる) - This is not mentioned in the passage.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nOption 2 best captures eBay's strategic goals of diversifying revenue sources and expanding into new geographical markets where Skype is strong.\n\n2"

      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses Beijing, China hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics. Key points:\n- Beijing will be the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics\n- This will make Beijing the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics\n- Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice events\n- Other snow sliding events will take place in the Taizicheng area in Zhangjiakou, approximately 220 kilometers (140 miles) from Beijing\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the passage, which of the following will NOT take place in Beijing city in 2022?\"\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n1. \"Sherehe za kufungua\" (Opening ceremonies) - The passage states Beijing will host opening ceremonies\n2. \"Matukio ya kuteleza kwenye theluji huko Taizicheng\" (Snow sliding events in Taizicheng) - The passage clearly states these will be in Taizicheng area in Zhangjiakou, which is 220km from Beijing\n3. \"Sherehe za kufunga\" (Closing ceremonies) - The passage states Beijing will host closing ceremonies  \n4. \"Matukio ya ndani kwenye barafu\" (Indoor ice events) - The passage states Beijing will host indoor ice events\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe snow sliding events in Taizicheng will NOT take place in Beijing city - they will be in Zhangjiakou, 220 kilometers away from Beijing.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses virtual teams (timu pepe) compared to regular teams (timu za kawaida). Key points:\n- Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as regular teams, but there are subtle differences\n- Virtual team members often use email as communication for their physical group at that time\n- They often have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones and may not be understood by their management\n- There's mention of \"invisible teams\" as a unique feature of virtual teams\n- \"Invisible teams\" are management teams where each member reports, and they set standards for each member\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, how are regular teams and virtual teams similar?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"Both are expected to have the same level of performance\" - The passage states \"Timu za kawaida zinashikiliwa kwa viwango sawa vya ubora kama timu za kawaida\" which means virtual teams are held to the same quality/performance standards as regular teams.\n\n2. \"Both teams have different levels of freedom in daily activities\" - The passage actually says virtual teams have MORE freedom than regular teams, not that both have different levels.\n\n3. \"Both teams work under invisible supervisors\" - The passage mentions \"invisible teams\" as a unique feature of virtual teams, not something both share.\n\n4. \"Both work in the same time zone area\" - The passage actually mentions that virtual teams can meet according to different time zones, which is a difference, not a similarity.\n\n**Step 4: Selecting the correct answer**\nOption 1 directly matches what the passage states about both types of teams being held to the same quality standards.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the passage is about:\nThe passage discusses medieval castles and how they evoke certain images and associations. It mentions that even when standing among ancient ruins, one can easily imagine the sounds and smells of past battles, and almost hear the clatter of hooves on stone roads and smell fear from underground dungeons. The passage then questions whether our ideas are based on reality and asks why castles were built and how they were designed.\n\nNow, let me examine the question:\nThe question asks: \"Which answer is NOT mentioned in the passage as something that can be associated with medieval castles?\"\n\nLet me check each option against what's mentioned in the passage:\n\n1. \"Jela za chini kwa chini\" (underground dungeons/prisons) - This IS mentioned in the passage: \"kunusa uoga kutoka kwenye jela za chini kwa chini\"\n\n2. \"Mashindano ya kivita\" (military competitions/battles) - This IS mentioned in the passage: \"picha za mashindano ya kivita\"\n\n3. \"Uungwana\" (nobility/chivalry) - This IS mentioned in the passage: \"uungwana wa Kiartha\"\n\n4. \"Mashujaa\" (heroes) - I need to check if this is mentioned anywhere in the passage. Looking through the text, I don't see any mention of heroes or \"mashujaa.\"\n\nThe passage mentions battles, nobility, dungeons, sounds of hooves, smells of fear, feasts, and chivalry, but it does not specifically mention heroes.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage**: The text discusses Indonesian cuisine, mentioning that with 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term covering a wide variety of foods found throughout the country.\n\n2. **Key focus**: The passage specifically mentions that when used without further qualifiers, the term typically refers to food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.\n\n3. **Identifying the relevant information**: The passage describes Javanese cuisine and lists its basic flavor components: \"njugu karanga, pilipili, sukari (hususan sukari ya nazi ya Javanese) na viungo tofauti vinavyonukia\" which translates to \"peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.\"\n\n4. **Analyzing the question**: The question asks \"Which of the following is commonly used in Javanese cuisine?\"\n\n5. **Examining the options**:\n   - Option 1: Sukari nyeupe (white sugar)\n   - Option 2: Sukari ya poda (powder sugar)\n   - Option 3: Sukari ya nazi (coconut sugar)\n   - Option 4: Sukari ya kahawia (brown sugar)\n\n6. **Finding the answer**: The passage specifically mentions \"sukari ya nazi ya Javanese\" (Javanese coconut sugar) as one of the basic flavoring ingredients commonly used in Javanese cuisine.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll identify the key information in the passage:\n   - Passengers were given water while waiting in 90-degree heat\n   - Fire Chief Scott Kouns made a statement\n   - He said it was a hot day in Santa Clara reaching 90 degrees\n   - He mentioned that being in aerial vehicles for any length of time would not be comfortable\n   - It took at least an hour to remove the first person from the vehicle\n\n2. Now I'll examine the question:\n   \"According to this passage, who gave the opinion that the high level of heat was unsuitable?\"\n\n3. Looking at who made statements about the heat:\n   - The passage specifically quotes \"Mkuu wa Zimamoto Scott Kouns\" (Fire Chief Scott Kouns)\n   - He is the one who commented on the heat conditions\n   - He described the uncomfortable conditions due to the 90-degree temperature\n   - He gave his professional opinion about how the heat made the situation difficult\n\n4. Checking the options:\n   1. Mwendeshaji vigari (Vehicle operator)\n   2. Msimamizi wa zima moto (Fire supervisor/chief)\n   3. Abiria (Passengers)\n   4. Mkuu wa polisi (Police chief)\n\n5. The passage clearly identifies Scott Kouns as \"Mkuu wa Zimamoto\" (Fire Chief), and he is the one quoted giving his opinion about the unsuitable heat conditions.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage**\nThe passage explains that stars produce light and heat because of energy generated when hydrogen atoms are combined (or fused) together to form heavier elements. Scientists are working to create nuclear reactors that can generate energy in the same way. However, this is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before suitable nuclear reactors are built.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, atomic fusion allows stars to do what?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. \"Kuunda elementi nzito zaidi\" = \"To form heavier elements\"\n2. \"Kujenga matanuri ya kinyuklia\" = \"To build nuclear reactors\"\n3. \"Kutoa mwanga na joto\" = \"To produce light and heat\"\n4. \"Kutengeneza atomi za hidrojeni\" = \"To generate hydrogen atoms\"\n\n**Step 4: Finding the correct answer**\nThe passage clearly states that stars produce light and heat (\"hutoa mwangaza na joto\") because of the energy generated when hydrogen atoms are fused together. While the fusion process does create heavier elements (option 1), the question asks what fusion allows stars to DO, and the primary function mentioned is producing light and heat.\n\nOption 2 is incorrect because stars don't build nuclear reactors - that's what scientists are trying to do.\nOption 4 is incorrect because fusion consumes hydrogen atoms rather than generating them.\n\nThe passage directly states that atomic fusion allows stars to produce light and heat.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses tradition and Charles's educational path. It mentions that traditionally, the heir to the throne would go directly to the military after finishing school. However, Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History, receiving a 2:2 degree (second class lower division). The passage then states that Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the information in this passage, Charles was the first to do what?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"Kujiunga na jeshi kabla ya kumaliza shule\" - To join the army before finishing school\n2. \"Kujifunza Akiolojia\" - To study Archaeology  \n3. \"Kupata digrii\" - To get a degree\n4. \"Kusomea Trinity College\" - To study at Trinity College\n\n**Finding the answer:**\nThe passage explicitly states: \"Charles alikuwa memba wa kwanza wa Familia ya Kifalme ya Kiingereza kuzawadiwa shahada ya digrii\" which translates to \"Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.\"\n\nThis directly corresponds to option 3 - \"Kupata digrii\" (to get a degree).\n\nThe other options are not supported by the text as \"firsts\" - the passage doesn't say he was the first royal to join the army before school, study archaeology, or attend Trinity College.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses scaffolding in education. It explains that:\n- Scaffolding should make education easier and more enjoyable\n- Teaching methods are not just ways of reading, but services that provide assistance to people going through new learning situations\n- Examples include using new computer programs or starting new projects\n- Platforms can be obvious or real - a teacher is a type of platform, as is the paper clip assistant in Microsoft Office\n- Email platforms are built into programs to question, persuade, and explain procedures that might be big challenges for students to handle alone\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the explanations in this passage, which of these is NOT an example of scaffolding/supportive instruction?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"Instructions at the beginning of a computer game\" - This would be scaffolding as it provides initial support for new users\n2. \"SAT teacher\" - This would be scaffolding as a teacher provides guidance and support\n3. \"Free training program\" - This would be scaffolding as it provides educational support\n4. \"Little league coach\" - While this involves teaching, it's more about sports coaching rather than the academic/educational scaffolding described in the passage\n\n**Step 4: Determining the answer**\nThe passage specifically focuses on educational scaffolding in academic contexts (computer programs, learning procedures, teachers as platforms). A little league coach, while providing instruction, is in a sports/recreational context rather than the educational scaffolding context described in the passage.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses hospitality exchange networks that connect travelers with local hosts in cities they visit. It explains:\n- To join such networks, you typically just need to fill out an online form\n- Some networks require additional verification\n- Lists of available hosts are provided in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers\n- The concept of staying in people's homes temporarily was established in January 2004\n- It started when software developer Casey Fenton got a cheap flight to Iceland but had nowhere to stay\n- He emailed university students locally and received many offers for free accommodation\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"What is given to travelers through hospitality exchange networks?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. \"Malazi na wenyeji\" = Accommodation and hosts\n2. \"Ndege za bei nafuu\" = Cheap flights\n3. \"Ziara zinazotolewa na waelekezi wa ndani\" = Tours provided by local guides\n4. \"Miunganisho na wasafiri wengine wanaotembelea eneo hilo\" = Connections with other travelers visiting the area\n\n**Step 4: Matching the passage content to the options**\nThe passage clearly states that these networks connect travelers with local hosts (\"wenyeji\") and provide accommodation (\"malazi\"). The story about Casey Fenton illustrates this - he received offers for free accommodation from local hosts. The passage doesn't mention flights, tours, or connections with other travelers as services provided by these networks.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses different types of tourism:\n\n1. **Recreational tourism (Utalii wa burudani)**: This is when people go to places that are very different from their everyday life to rest and enjoy themselves. Beaches, special parks, and camping areas are often visited by recreational tourists.\n\n2. **Cultural tourism (Utalii wa kitamaduni)**: This is when the goal of a traveler visiting a specific place is to learn about its history and culture. Tourists may visit different landmarks of specific countries or choose to focus on just one area.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"What type of tourism is visiting museums?\" (Kutembelea makumbusho ni aina gani ya utalii?)\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. Business tourism (Utalii wa kibiashara)\n2. Recreational tourism (Utalii wa burudani)\n3. Cultural tourism (Utalii wa kitamaduni)\n4. Outdoor activities tourism (Utalii wa shughuli za nje)\n\n**Step 4: Making the connection**\nMuseums are places where people go to learn about history, culture, art, and heritage. According to the passage, when the goal of visiting a place is \"to learn about its history and culture\" (kujua historia na utamaduni), this type of tourism is called \"cultural tourism\" (utalii wa kitamaduni).\n\nVisiting museums clearly fits this definition as museums are specifically designed to preserve and display cultural artifacts, historical items, and educational content about heritage and culture.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses \"reverse culture shock\" - the shock of returning home after living abroad. Key points:\n\n1. Reverse culture shock comes faster than initial culture shock, has a shorter honeymoon period, lasts longer, and can be more intense.\n\n2. Travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a harder time readjusting to their original culture.\n\n3. When returning home after living abroad, you've become accustomed to the new culture and lost some behaviors from your home culture.\n\n4. When you first went abroad, people were patient and understanding, knowing travelers in foreign countries need to adapt. People may not expect that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, reverse culture shock can be especially difficult for what type of traveler?\"\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n\n1. \"Travelers who experienced particularly bad culture shock\" - The passage doesn't mention this connection.\n\n2. \"Travelers who adapted quickly when they were living abroad\" - This directly matches the passage, which states that travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a harder time readjusting to their original culture.\n\n3. \"Travelers who are still in the honeymoon period\" - The passage mentions the honeymoon period is shorter for reverse culture shock, but doesn't say these travelers have it especially difficult.\n\n4. \"Travelers with little patience\" - The passage discusses others' patience toward returning travelers, not the travelers' own patience levels.\n\nThe passage clearly states that those who easily adapted to foreign culture may struggle more with readjustment upon return.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage is about boomerang throwing, which is described as a famous skill that many tourists want to learn. It explains that if you want to know how to throw a boomerang that returns to your hand, you need to make sure you have the right boomerang that will return. Many boomerangs available in Australia are not the returning type. It's good for beginners not to try throwing them during windy conditions.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, which of the following statements correctly describes boomerang throwing?\"\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n1. \"It will return to your hand every time if thrown correctly\" - This is too absolute. The passage emphasizes you need the RIGHT type of boomerang, not just correct throwing technique.\n\n2. \"It is more popular among locals than tourists\" - This contradicts the passage, which states that many tourists want to learn this skill.\n\n3. \"There are not many boomerangs available in Australia\" - This is incorrect. The passage says many boomerangs are available in Australia, but many of them don't return.\n\n4. \"Only some boomerangs can return\" - This correctly reflects the passage's main point that \"many boomerangs available in Australia are not the returning type,\" implying that only certain boomerangs have the returning capability.\n\nThe passage's key message is that not all boomerangs return - you need to have the right type of boomerang for it to return to your hand.\n\n4",

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about bow markings and techniques for string instruments (likely violin or similar). Let me break down what it says:\n\n1. The \"up bow\" sign looks like a V, and the \"down bow\" sign looks like a bracket or square missing its bottom side.\n\n2. \"Up\" (juu) means you should start from inside and push the bow.\n\n3. \"Down\" (chini) means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.\n\n4. Up bow typically produces a quiet sound, while down bow is stronger and more solid.\n\n5. The passage mentions that printed bow markings exist for musical reasons and should be respected.\n\nNow, let me analyze what relates to \"down bow\" (gubeti la chini):\n- Down bow starts from the frog (kuanza kwenye frog)\n- Down bow produces stronger, more solid sound (sauti yenye nguvu zaidi)\n- Down bow sign looks like a bracket (alama inayoonekana kama kibanio)\n\nThe question asks which of the following is NOT related to down bow (kuvuta gubeti):\n\n1. Quiet sound (Sauti tulivu) - This is associated with UP bow, not down bow\n2. Sign that looks like a bracket (Alama inayoonekana kama kibanio) - This IS related to down bow\n3. Stronger sound (Sauti yenye nguvu zaidi) - This IS related to down bow  \n4. Starting at the frog (Kuanza kwenye frog) - This IS related to down bow\n\nThe answer is option 1, as \"quiet sound\" is specifically mentioned as characteristic of up bow, not down bow.\n\n1",

      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the main problem described**\nThe passage discusses the difficulty that large animals with human-like digestive systems face in the savanna when trying to meet their amino acid requirements from plant materials alone. The consequences of failing to do so include stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying what plant resources are available but problematic**\nThe passage mentions that easily accessible plant resources would be proteins found in grass (majani) and beans (kunde), but these are difficult for high-level mammals like humans to digest unless they are cooked.\n\n**Step 3: Understanding the proposed solution**\nThe passage contrasts plant foods with animal foods (ants, termites, eggs), noting that animal foods are not only easier to chew/process but also provide high-quality proteins with essential amino acids.\n\n**Step 4: Connecting to the conclusion**\nThe passage concludes that our ancestors likely solved their \"protein problem\" in the same way that savanna primates do today - presumably by eating animal foods.\n\n**Step 5: Analyzing the question and options**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, which of these should large animals eat to solve the 'protein problem'?\"\n\nOptions:\n1. Dried grass (majani yaliyokauka)\n2. Uncooked beans (kunde ambazo hazijapikwa)\n3. Insects (panzi)\n4. Flower machines/parts (mashina ya maua)\n\n**Step 6: Selecting the correct answer**\nBased on the passage, plant materials (options 1, 2, and 4) are problematic because they're hard to digest for mammals with human-like digestive systems. The passage specifically mentions that animal foods like ants and termites provide the solution. Option 3 (panzi - insects) aligns with this animal-based solution mentioned in the text.\n\n3",

      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses gravity on Io (Jupiter's moon). It asks \"How would Io's gravity pull you?\" and explains that if you stood on Io's surface, you would weigh less than you do on Earth. It gives a specific example: a person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. The passage concludes that gravity pulls much less on you there.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, which of the following statements is correct about gravity on the planet Io?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"Earth's gravity would pull you less than Io's gravity\" - This contradicts the passage\n2. \"Io's gravity pulls more, that's why your weight would decrease\" - This is contradictory (if gravity pulls more, weight would increase, not decrease)\n3. \"Io's gravity pulls more, that's why your weight would increase\" - This contradicts the passage which says weight decreases\n4. \"Earth's gravity would pull you more than Io's gravity\" - This matches the passage\n\n**Logic:**\nThe passage clearly states that you would weigh much less on Io (36 pounds vs 200 pounds), which means Io's gravity is weaker than Earth's gravity. Therefore, Earth's gravity pulls you more than Io's gravity does.\n\n4",

Triceratops teeth could crush not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.\n\n2. Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads, which were common plants during the Cretaceous period.\n\n3. These plants looked like small palm trees with crowns of sharp-pointed leaves with thorns.\n\n4. The passage specifically states: \"Triceratops angeutumia mdomo wake wenye nguvu kuyatoa majani kabla ya kula shina\" - which translates to \"Triceratops would use its powerful mouth to remove the leaves before eating the stem/trunk.\"\n\n5. Other scientists argue these plants were poisonous, so no dinosaur would eat them, though today some animals like iguanas and parrots can eat poisonous plant parts.\n\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, which part of the cycad plant could Triceratops eat?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Thorny leaves (majani yenye miba)\n2. Stem/trunk (shina)\n3. Roots (mzizi)\n4.

Key points include:\n\n1. In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Nyiragongo volcano, which covered many city neighborhoods, especially the city center\n2. While Goma is generally safe, any visits outside Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province\n3. The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and has the easiest routes for tracking Mountain Gorillas in Africa\n4. You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma, with typical local fare being 500 Congolese Francs for short trips\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following would NOT be good advice for a tourist in Goma?\"\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n1. \"Fighting in North Kivu is entertaining\" - This contradicts the passage which warns tourists to research the conflict situation for safety reasons. This would be terrible advice.\n\n2. \"It's a good place for Mountain Gorilla tracking at affordable prices\" - This aligns with the passage stating Goma has the easiest routes for gorilla tracking in Africa.\n\n3. \"Motorcycle taxis are a good way to get around\" - This matches the passage's information about using boda-boda to move around Goma.\n\n4. \"The base of Nyiragongo volcano is in the city\" - This aligns with the passage stating the city is a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano.\n\nOption 1 is clearly dangerous and inappropriate advice, as it treats serious armed conflict as entertainment when the passage emphasizes the need for caution.\n\n1",

It mentions there are basically two groups of approaches: working while traveling, or trying to reduce your costs. The text focuses on the latter approach - budget travel.\n\n**Step 2: Key information about budget travel requirements**\nThe passage states that for those ready to give up comfort, time, and predictability to reduce costs to zero, they should look at very low budget travel. However, this advice assumes that travelers:\n- Are not in a hurry\n- Have no interference/obligations\n- Don't participate in illegal markets\n- Don't beg\n- Don't exploit others for their benefit\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, who would have a hard time traveling on a very low budget?\"\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating each option**\n1. Someone who welcomes challenges - This person would likely adapt well to budget travel difficulties\n2. Someone who has enough time - This aligns with the passage's requirement of not being in a hurry\n3. Someone planning to work while traveling - The passage mentions this as a separate approach, not necessarily incompatible with budget travel\n4. Someone who likes to follow a schedule - This directly conflicts with the passage's requirement to give up \"predictability\" (utabiri) and time constraints\n\n**Step 5: Identifying the correct answer**\nThe passage specifically mentions that budget travelers must be willing to give up \"utabiri\" (predictability/planning). Someone who likes to follow a schedule would struggle with this requirement.\n\n4",

      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage**\nThe passage discusses time as a concept that surrounds us and affects everything we do, but is difficult to understand. It mentions that time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years. We experience time as a series of events passing from future through present to past. Time is also how we measure the duration of events. The passage explains that we can mark the passage of time by observing the repetition of cyclical events, which are things that happen again and again many times.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"What should be considered about cyclical events in order to track the passage of time?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. Muda (Time/Duration)\n2. Marudio (Repetition)\n3. Athari (Effects/Consequences)\n4. Ugumu (Difficulty)\n\n**Step 4: Finding the answer in the passage**\nThe key sentence in the passage states: \"Unaweza kuweka alama ya upitaji wa saa wewe mwenyewe kwa kuangalia marudio ya tukio la kimzunguko\" which translates to \"You can mark the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of cyclical events.\"\n\nThe passage explicitly mentions that to track time's passage, one should observe the \"marudio\" (repetition) of cyclical events. This makes sense because cyclical events are defined as things that happen \"tena na tena mara nyingi\" (again and again many times), and it's this repetitive nature that allows us to measure time.\n\n2",

This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years. Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections. The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the government that began in October. These protests, which were sometimes violent, were initiated due to the lack of elections, some of which had been delayed since 2011.\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"Which statement about the protests is NOT true?\"\n\n**Examining each option:**\n\n1. \"The presidential commission was a response to the protests\" - This is TRUE according to the passage, which states \"Tume ilikuwa jibu la Martelly kwa maandamano\" (The commission was Martelly's response to the protests).\n\n2. \"The delay of elections caused these protests\" - This is TRUE according to the passage, which mentions protests were \"yalianzishwa na ukosefu wa kuwa na uchaguzi, ambapo mwingine ulichelewa tangu 2011\" (initiated by the lack of elections, some of which were delayed since 2011).\n\n3. \"The protests demanded the resignation of the previous CEP\" - This is NOT directly stated in the passage. The passage says the presidential commission recommended the CEP's resignation, but it doesn't say the protests specifically demanded this resignation.\n\n4. \"Sometimes these protests were violent\" - This is TRUE according to the passage, which states \"ambayo wakati mwingine huwa jeuri\" (which sometimes were violent).\n\nThe question asks for the statement that is NOT true. Option 3 makes a claim not supported by the passage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage is about Johnny Reid, a co-driver for New Zealand's A1GP team, who made history by driving on Auckland Harbor Bridge (which is 48 years old) legally. Mr. Reid was able to drive New Zealand's A1GP car, called \"Black Beauty,\" at speeds over 160 km/h seven times across the bridge. The New Zealand police had difficulty using their speed radar guns to see how Mr. Reid was driving because the beauty was low, but the police were able to catch Mr. Reid when he reduced his speed to 160 km/h.\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"When were the police able to use radar guns to measure Johnny Reid's driving speed?\"\n\n**Examining the key information:**\nThe passage states that police had difficulty using their radar guns because the car was low, BUT they were able to catch/measure Mr. Reid when he reduced his speed to 160 km/h (\"wakati polisi waliweza kumuweka Bwana Reid wakati alipopunguza mwendo hadi 160 Km/h\").\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n1. \"When he was driving at 160km/h\" - This matches the passage\n2. \"His seventh time crossing the bridge\" - No specific mention of this timing\n3. \"When he was driving over 160km/h\" - The passage says they had difficulty when he was going faster\n4. \"His first time on the bridge\" - No mention of this timing\n\nThe passage clearly indicates that police could use their radar guns when Reid slowed down to 160 km/h, not when he was going faster.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage**\nThe passage is about \"bizari\" (curry/spiced dish) and describes:\n- Bizari is food made with plants and spices, along with meat or vegetables\n- It can be \"dry\" or \"moist\" depending on the amount of liquid\n- In Northern India and Pakistan regions, \"mtindi\" (yogurt) is commonly used in spiced sauces\n- In Southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"In some regions, coconut milk is sometimes used instead of which ingredient in bizari?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. Nyama (meat)\n2. Mboga (vegetables) \n3. Mtindi (yogurt)\n4. Viungo (spices)\n\n**Step 4: Finding the answer**\nThe passage clearly states that:\n- In Northern regions: mtindi (yogurt) is commonly used in spiced sauces\n- In Southern regions: coconut milk is widely used\n\nThis indicates that coconut milk is used as an alternative to yogurt (mtindi) in different regional preparations of bizari.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage describes a region bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west. It then gives advice specifically for female travelers, including:\n- They should say they are married regardless of their actual marital status\n- They should wear a ring (but not one that appears too expensive)\n- Women should recognize that cultural differences may cause what they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, have their hand grabbed, etc.\n- Be firm in rejecting people and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't make harassment acceptable)\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the area described in the passage, what advice can help female travelers?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"Recognize that it's not uncommon to be followed\" - This is mentioned in the passage but as a warning about what might happen, not as helpful advice.\n\n2. \"Wear a big ring to indicate marital status\" - The passage mentions wearing a ring but specifically says it should NOT appear too expensive, so \"big\" contradicts this advice.\n\n3. \"Understand that cultural differences suggest you should avoid standing your ground\" - This contradicts the passage, which explicitly says to be firm and stand your ground despite cultural differences.\n\n4. \"When there is unwanted harassment, be firm in rejecting men\" - This directly matches the advice given in the passage: \"Kuwa imara katika kuwakatalia watu\" (be firm in rejecting people).\n\n**Step 4: Selecting the correct answer**\nOption 4 accurately reflects the constructive advice given in the passage about how female travelers should respond to unwanted attention.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about the distribution of the Declaration of Independence (referred to as \"Dunlap broadsides\" or \"Vikaratasi vya Dunlop\" in Swahili) after it was approved by Congress on July 4th.\n\nKey timeline from the passage:\n1. The document was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop where 150-200 copies were made overnight\n2. July 8 - First public reading by John Nixon at Independence Hall (Ukumbi wa Uhuru)\n3. July 6 - One copy was sent to George Washington\n4. July 9 - Washington had it read to his troops in New York\n5. August 10 - A copy reached London\n\nThe question asks: \"Among these places, which was the last to receive the Dunlap broadsides?\"\n\nLooking at the chronological order:\n- July 6: Copy sent to Washington\n- July 8: Read at Independence Hall\n- July 9: Read to troops in New York\n- August 10: Copy reached London\n\nLondon received the copy on August 10, which is the latest date mentioned among all the locations listed in the options.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the passage is saying:\nThe passage describes Majorcan food, stating that like other areas in the Mediterranean region, it is made with bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and always uses olive oil. It mentions a simple evening meal, especially during summer, called \"Pa ambi Oli\" which consists of bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and other available ingredients like cheese and tuna.\n\nNow, let me examine the question:\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, which of the following is NOT a main food component of Majorcan cuisine?\"\n\nLet me check each option against what's mentioned in the passage:\n\n1. Nyama (Meat) - The passage explicitly mentions \"nyama\" (meat, especially pork) as one of the main components\n2. Mkate (Bread) - The passage explicitly mentions \"mkate\" (bread) as one of the main components\n3. Nafaka (Grains/cereals) - This is NOT specifically mentioned in the passage as a main component\n4. Mboga (Vegetables) - The passage explicitly mentions \"mboga\" (vegetables) as one of the main components\n\nThe passage clearly states that Majorcan food is made with three main components: mkate (bread), mboga (vegetables), and nyama (meat), plus olive oil. Nafaka (grains/cereals) is not mentioned as a main component of Majorcan cuisine in this passage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses avalanches (maporomoko ya theluji). It explains that:\n- Avalanches are not ordinary occurrences\n- Steep slopes can hold snow to a certain level, but excess amounts will fall as avalanches\n- The problem is that snow is deceptive and needs to be triggered to slide down\n- A small amount of snow sliding can become a triggering event for the rest\n- Sometimes the natural triggering event is the sun heating the snow\n- Sometimes it's more snowfall\n- Sometimes it's natural events, often involving humans\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"Among the following, which is NOT a trigger for avalanches?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. Theluji danganyifu (Deceptive snow) - The passage mentions that snow is deceptive, but this describes a characteristic of snow that makes avalanches possible, not a trigger\n2. Binadamu (Humans) - The passage explicitly mentions \"mara nyingi binadamu\" (often humans) as triggers\n3. Mwanga wa jua (Sunlight) - The passage mentions \"jua kupasha joto theluji\" (sun heating the snow) as a trigger\n4. Kuanguka zaidi kwa theluji (More snowfall) - The passage mentions this as a trigger\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption 1 (deceptive snow) is described as a characteristic that makes snow unstable and requiring triggering, but it's not itself a trigger. The other three options are all mentioned as actual triggers in the passage.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify what the passage says about Homer:\n- The passage mentions that Homer was a well-known figure in Greek culture\n- It describes him as \"malenga wa mashairi aliyekuwa kipofu\" (a poet who was blind)\n- It states he created two great works of Greek literature: the Iliad and Odyssey\n\nNow I'll examine the question:\n\"Je, Mshairi wa Kigiriki Homer hakuweza kufanya nini?\" \nThis translates to: \"What could the Greek poet Homer not do?\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. Kusikia (to hear)\n2. Kuona (to see)\n3. Kutembea (to walk)\n4. Kuongea (to speak)\n\nThe key information from the passage is that Homer was described as \"kipofu,\" which means \"blind\" in Swahili. Being blind means he could not see.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention any problems with his hearing, walking, or speaking abilities. In fact, since he was a poet who created epic works, he clearly could speak/recite poetry.\n\nTherefore, based on the passage stating that Homer was blind (kipofu), the thing he could not do was see (kuona).\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage discusses airline companies like Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, and Turkish Airlines that have expanded their services significantly in Africa, offering connections to many important African cities at better prices than other British companies. Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries as of 2014. \n\nThe passage then advises that if you have extra time to travel, you should check how your total fare to Africa compares with a round-the-world fare. It specifically mentions that you should not forget to add extra costs for additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc., for all those areas outside of Africa.\n\nThe question asks: \"What does NOT need to be added when comparing the total fare to Africa with international fares?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. Cost of additional visas for areas outside Africa - The passage says to add this\n2. Cost of departure taxes from the African continent - The passage mentions departure taxes should be added\n3. Cost of African visas - The passage does NOT mention adding African visa costs; it only mentions adding costs for areas \"outside of Africa\"\n4. Cost of ground transportation for areas outside Africa - The passage says to add this\n\nThe key phrase in the passage is \"kwa sehemu hizo zote nje ya Afrika\" (for all those areas outside of Africa). This indicates that only costs related to areas outside Africa need to be added, not costs within Africa itself.\n\nTherefore, African visa costs would not need to be added since they are part of the Africa travel costs, not additional costs for areas outside Africa.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage is about Hu (likely a Chinese leader) making statements about carbon dioxide emissions reduction. He mentions:\n- China will try to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per GDP unit significantly by 2020 compared to 2005 levels\n- He did not set a specific reduction level/target\n- The reduction will be done according to China's economic output\n- He emphasized that developing countries should avoid the old path of \"pollute first, clean later\"\n- He added that developing countries shouldn't be asked to take on responsibilities beyond their development stage, accountability, and capacity\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\n\"Ni nini hakikutajwa na Hu?\" means \"What was NOT mentioned by Hu?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"Msingi wa upunguzaji\" = \"Basis for reduction\" - This WAS mentioned (he said it would be based on economic output)\n2. \"Ushauri kwa nchi zinazoendelea kuhusu uchafuzi wa mazingira\" = \"Advice to developing countries about environmental pollution\" - This WAS mentioned (avoid pollute first, clean later approach)\n3. \"Wakati ambapo utoaji wa kaboni utapunguzwa\" = \"Time when carbon emissions will be reduced\" - This WAS mentioned (by 2020)\n4. \"Nambari ya kupunguzwa kwa utoaji wa kaboni\" = \"Specific number/amount of carbon emission reduction\" - This was NOT mentioned (the passage explicitly states he didn't set a specific reduction level)\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe passage explicitly states that Hu did not set a specific reduction target/number, making option 4 the correct answer.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step.\n\nThe passage is about Babylonian temples and religious practices. Let me break down the key information:\n\n1. The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, considered to be the house of that god\n2. People would bring sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to meet the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivities\n3. Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sacred place where only priests could enter\n4. Sometimes special pyramid-like towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temple\n5. The top section was the sacred dwelling of the god\n\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, where would you NOT find ordinary citizens of Babylon?\"\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n1. \"Bringing sacrifices in the temple courtyard\" - The passage says people brought sacrifices to the gods, and mentions open courtyards, so ordinary people could be here.\n\n2. \"Attending ceremonies in the main temple\" - The passage mentions ceremonies that priests organized for the gods' needs, suggesting people could attend.\n\n3. \"At festivities in the temple courtyard\" - The passage mentions festivities (tamasha) that priests organized, and these would likely be in accessible areas.\n\n4. \"Bringing sacrifices to the inner sacred place\" - The passage specifically states that the inner sacred place (mahali pa ndani patakatifu) was where \"only priests could enter\" (ni makasisi tu wangeweza kuingia).\n\nThe key phrase is that only priests could enter the inner sacred place. Therefore, ordinary citizens would NOT be found bringing sacrifices to this inner sacred area.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses what happens when a light bulb stops working and how to safely replace it. Let me break down the key points:\n\n- After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament inside the bulb burns out and the light bulb can no longer function\n- The light bulb then needs to be replaced\n- It's important to be careful when replacing a light bulb\n- First, the light switch needs to be turned off or the wires disconnected\n- This is because electricity flowing through the socket (where the metal part of the bulb sits) can give you a major electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal part of the bulb if there's still a piece remaining in the hole\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, what causes the light bulb to stop working?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. The light switch not being turned off properly\n2. The bottom metal part of the bulb remaining outside the hole\n3. The wire/filament inside the bulb burning out\n4. Reduction in electrical flow through the hole\n\n**Step 4: Finding the correct answer**\nLooking back at the passage, the very first sentence clearly states: \"After hundreds of hours of operation, finally the filament of the bulb burns out and the light bulb can no longer work.\" The Swahili phrase \"uzi wa balbu unaungua\" translates to \"the wire/filament of the bulb burns out.\"\n\nThe other options relate to safety concerns during replacement or installation issues, but they are not mentioned as causes of the bulb stopping working.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about dress code requirements when visiting monasteries or religious houses. Let me break down what it says:\n\n1. Women are expected to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders\n2. Many monasteries provide \"kanga\" (traditional cloth wraps) for women who come without proper covering\n3. If you bring your own kanga, especially one with bright colors, you'll get smiles from monks or sisters at the entrance\n4. Men are required to wear pants that cover their knees\n5. These can also be borrowed from the stock at the gate, but these clothes are not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing them\n6. One size fits all for men!\n\nNow, looking at the question: \"Which of the following clothes cannot be borrowed from the monastery?\"\n\nThe options are:\n1. Sketi (Skirts)\n2. Suruali fupi (Short pants/shorts)\n3. Suruali ndefu (Long pants)\n4. Kanga (Traditional cloth wraps)\n\nFrom the passage, I can see that:\n- Kanga can be borrowed (the passage explicitly states monasteries provide kanga for women)\n- Long pants can be borrowed for men (the passage mentions these can be borrowed from stock at the gate)\n- The passage doesn't mention that skirts can be borrowed - only kanga for women\n- Short pants wouldn't be appropriate anyway since the dress code requires covering knees\n\nThe passage indicates that monasteries provide kanga for women and long pants for men, but doesn't mention providing skirts. Short pants would violate the dress code requirement of covering knees.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage describes a sports match (likely rugby, given the mention of \"raga ya watu 7\" - 7-person rugby) that started at 10 AM with good weather conditions. Despite some mid-morning drizzle that ended quickly, it was a good day for the 7-person rugby match.\n\n**Key events described:**\n1. South Africa (the top team in the competition) started well\n2. They easily defeated Zambia (ranked 5th) with a score of 26-0\n3. Initially, South Africa appeared to weaken in the game against their \"southern sisters\" (likely referring to another team)\n4. However, as the competition continued (\"jinsi mashindano yalivyoendelea\"), South Africa improved their performance\n5. Their disciplined defense, ball-handling skills, and good teamwork made them emerge stronger, and it became clear they were the team to beat\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, when did South Africa's game start to improve?\"\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n1. \"Around 4 AM\" - This doesn't match anything in the text (the game started at 10 AM)\n2. \"After strengthening their defense\" - The text mentions their disciplined defense as a result of improvement, not the cause\n3. \"After being defeated by Zambia\" - This is incorrect; South Africa defeated Zambia 26-0\n4. \"As the competition continued\" - This matches the text \"jinsi mashindano yalivyoendelea\" (as the competition continued)\n\nThe passage clearly states that South Africa improved \"jinsi mashindano yalivyoendelea\" (as the competition continued).\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage**\nThe passage discusses 20th-century research showing there are two types of genetic variation: hidden (fiche) and explained/visible (zilizoelezewa). It mentions that changes increase morphological differences, and selection removes them from the collection of shown variations. It also mentions processes of separation and mixing between these two pools in each generation.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"What process is involved in increasing genetic variation?\" (Je, ni mchakato upi unahusika na kuongeza utofauti wa jeni?)\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. Utengaji = Separation/Segregation\n2. Uchanganyaji = Mixing/Recombination\n3. Mabadiliko = Changes/Mutations\n4. Zilizoonyeshwa = Those that are shown/expressed\n\n**Step 4: Finding the answer in the passage**\nThe passage specifically states: \"Mabadiliko huongeza tofauti za kimaumbile\" which translates to \"Changes increase morphological differences.\" This directly answers the question about what process increases genetic variation.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly identifies \"mabadiliko\" (changes/mutations) as the process that increases variation, while selection removes variation from the visible pool.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage is about Bobek, who was born in Zagreb, Croatia's capital. It states that:\n- He gained fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade\n- He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958\n- During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 matches\n- No one else had appeared more or scored more goals for the club than Bobek\n- In 1995, he was chosen as the best player in Partizan's history\n\n**Analyzing the question:**\nThe question asks: \"Which statement about Bobek's history with Partizan Belgrade is true?\"\n\n**Evaluating each option:**\n\n1. \"He started playing for Partizan in 1945\" - The passage clearly states \"Alijiunga nao mwaka wa 1945\" (he joined them in 1945). This is TRUE.\n\n2. \"He played for Zagreb before Partizan Belgrade\" - The passage only mentions he was born in Zagreb, not that he played for a team there. This is NOT stated.\n\n3. \"He played for Partizan until 1995\" - The passage says he played until 1958 (\"akakaa hadi mwaka wa 1958\"), and 1995 is when he was chosen as best player in history. This is FALSE.\n\n4. \"He gained fame after being chosen as Partizan's best player\" - The passage states he gained fame while playing for Partizan, and the 1995 recognition came much later (after his playing career ended in 1958). This is FALSE.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage**\nThe passage discusses how children develop national consciousness and national stereotypes from a young age, and how these national stereotypes affect behavior. It gives an example that children who are associated with minority groups that are believed to not perform well in school will indeed not perform well in school once they discover the concepts associated with their ethnic group.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to this passage, a child's knowledge about ethnic concepts can affect which of the following?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. \"Jamii ya wachache wanayochagua kujitambulisha nayo\" - The minority community they choose to identify with\n2. \"Tabia yao\" - Their behavior\n3. \"Uhusiano wao na watoto wengine\" - Their relationships with other children\n4. \"Ufafanuzi wao wa kabila\" - Their interpretation of ethnicity\n\n**Step 4: Finding the answer in the passage**\nThe passage explicitly states that \"kasumba hizo za utaifa huathiri tabia\" (these national stereotypes affect behavior). It then provides a concrete example of how children's awareness of ethnic stereotypes affects their academic performance (which is a form of behavior).\n\nThe passage directly connects children's understanding of ethnic concepts to changes in their behavior - specifically their academic performance.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly indicates that children's knowledge about ethnic concepts affects their behavior.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this Swahili passage step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage**\nThe passage discusses a major purchase in eBay's history. It states that the company hopes to expand its revenue sources and gain popularity in areas where Skype has an established position, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"What is eBay trying to achieve through this purchase?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. \"Kukusanya mapato yake\" = To collect/gather its revenue\n2. \"Kuingia katika masoko mapya\" = To enter new markets\n3. \"Kuboresha wasifu wake\" = To improve its profile/image\n4. \"Kuridhisha wanahisa wake\" = To satisfy its shareholders\n\n**Step 4: Matching passage content to options**\nThe passage specifically mentions that eBay wants to:\n- Expand its revenue sources (\"kupanua vyanzo vyake vya faida\")\n- Gain popularity in areas where Skype has established positions (\"kupata umaarufu katika maeneo ambako Skype inamiliki nafasi thabiti\")\n- Target specific regions like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil\n\nThis clearly indicates eBay is trying to enter new markets where Skype already has a strong presence.\n\n**Step 5: Selecting the best answer**\nOption 2 (\"Kuingia katika masoko mapya\" - To enter new markets) best captures eBay's goal of expanding into regions where Skype has established positions.\n\n2"

      "Let me analyze this Hindi passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses findings about the Sun and other stars. It states that:\n- The Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars\n- All stars in the galaxy have their activity driven by their light and their rotation, not by any other cause\n- A star's Rossby number (related to plasma flow) is determined using both brightness and rotation together\n- The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be regarding magnetic reversal\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the key question**\nThe question asks: \"Which of these stimulates/drives the operation of the Sun and other stars?\"\n\n**Step 3: Finding the answer in the passage**\nThe passage clearly states: \"मंडल के सभी सितारों की गतिविधि उनके प्रकाश, उनके परिक्रमण द्वारा संचालित थी, किसी और कारण से नहीं\"\nThis translates to: \"All stars in the galaxy have their activity driven by their light and their rotation, not by any other cause.\"\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the options**\n1. Brightness and plasma flow - Plasma flow is mentioned but not as a driving force\n2. Rossby number, rotation and magnetic reversal - These are mentioned but Rossby number and magnetic reversal are not described as driving forces\n3. Rotation and brightness - This matches exactly what the passage states as the driving forces\n4. Brightness, Rossby number and rotation - Includes Rossby number which is not mentioned as a driving force\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage explicitly states that stellar activity is driven by light (brightness) and rotation, nothing else.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses virtual teams and how they compare to traditional teams. It mentions:\n- Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences\n- Virtual team members often serve as contact points for their immediate physical groups\n- They have more freedom than traditional team members because their teams can meet across different time zones\n- There's a concept of \"invisible team\" - a management team that each member reports to and that sets standards\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the passage, how are regular teams and virtual teams similar?\"\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating each option**\n\nOption 1: \"Both teams are expected to perform at the same level\"\n- The passage clearly states: \"वर्चुअल टीमों को भी परंपरागत टीमों की तरह ही उत्कृष्टता के समान मानकों पर रखा जाता है\" (Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams)\n- This directly supports this option\n\nOption 2: \"Both teams work independently to different degrees in day-to-day activities\"\n- The passage mentions virtual teams have MORE freedom, indicating a difference rather than similarity\n- This describes a difference, not a similarity\n\nOption 3: \"Both teams report to an invisible management team\"\n- The passage only mentions the \"invisible team\" concept in relation to virtual teams\n- No indication that traditional teams also have this structure\n\nOption 4: \"Both teams work in the same time zone\"\n- The passage specifically mentions virtual teams can meet across different time zones\n- This contradicts what's stated in the passage\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe passage explicitly states that virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, which directly corresponds to option 1.\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this Hindi passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses traditional medieval castles and how they have long inspired imagination. It mentions:\n- Images of jousts (जत्थों), feasts (भोजों), and Arthurian chivalry (आर्थरियन शिष्टता)\n- Standing among thousand-year-old ruins and imagining sounds of long battles\n- The sound of hooves clattering on cobblestones (कोयलों पर खुरों की खटपट)\n- Fear rising from dungeon graves/pits (कालकोठरी के कब्रों से उठने वाले डर)\n- Questions about why castles were built and how they were designed\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing what IS mentioned in the passage**\nFrom the options given:\n1. कालकोठरी के गड्ढे (dungeon pits) - YES, mentioned as \"कालकोठरी के कब्रों\"\n2. जोउस्ट्स (jousts) - YES, mentioned as \"जत्थों\"\n3. क्षात्रधर्म (chivalry) - YES, mentioned as \"आर्थरियन शिष्टता\"\n4. शूरवीर (knights) - This is NOT explicitly mentioned in the passage\n\n**Step 3: Identifying what is NOT mentioned**\nThe question asks what is NOT mentioned in the passage that could be related to medieval fortification. While the passage talks about jousts, chivalry, dungeons, battles, and castle imagery, it does not specifically mention \"शूरवीर\" (knights/warriors).\n\n**Step 4: Verification**\nLooking through the passage again:\n- Jousts (जत्थों) ✓\n- Chivalry (आर्थरियन शिष्टता) ✓  \n- Dungeon pits (कालकोठरी के कब्रों) ✓\n- Knights (शूरवीर) ✗ - Not explicitly mentioned\n\n4",

      "Let me analyze this Hindi passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage**\nThe passage discusses nuclear fusion and its role in stars. It explains that when hydrogen atoms undergo fusion to create heavier elements, energy is released, and this energy is what allows stars to provide light and heat. The passage also mentions that scientists are working to build reactors that can produce energy in the same way, but this is a very difficult problem that will take many years to solve before useful fusion reactors can be built.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the passage, what does fusion allow stars to do?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. \"भारी तत्व बनाते हैं\" = \"Create heavy elements\"\n2. \"फ्यूजन रिएक्टर बनाएं\" = \"Build fusion reactors\" \n3. \"प्रकाश और गर्मी दो\" = \"Give light and heat\"\n4. \"हाइड्रोजन परमाणु बनाएँ\" = \"Create hydrogen atoms\"\n\n**Step 4: Finding the answer in the passage**\nThe passage clearly states: \"जो उर्जा निकलती है, उसी से सितारे प्रकाश और गर्मी प्रदान करते हैं\" which translates to \"the energy that is released is what allows stars to provide light and heat.\"\n\nWhile fusion does create heavy elements (option 1), the question specifically asks what fusion allows stars to DO, and the passage emphasizes that the energy from fusion enables stars to provide light and heat.\n\nOptions 2 and 4 are clearly incorrect as stars don't build fusion reactors or create hydrogen atoms.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses the traditional path for throne successors versus what Charles actually did. It states:\n- Traditionally, throne successors would go directly to the army after completing school education\n- However, Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge university instead\n- At university, he studied anthropology, archaeology, and later history\n- He received a 2:2 (lower second-class degree)\n- Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a degree\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"Based on the given information, what did Charles do first?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. Join the army before finishing school - This contradicts the passage, which says traditionally successors join army AFTER completing school, and Charles didn't follow this tradition anyway\n2. Study archaeology - This happened at university, so it's not the first thing he did\n3. Earn a degree - This was the end result of his university education, not the first step\n4. Attend Trinity College - According to the passage, after completing school education, Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge. This would be the first action mentioned in his educational journey\n\n**Logical sequence:**\nThe passage implies Charles first completed school → then went to Trinity College → studied various subjects including archaeology → earned his degree.\n\nTherefore, the first thing Charles did (in the context of the information provided) was attend Trinity College.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage discusses scaffolding in learning. Key points:\n1. Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further\n2. Scaffolding is not a learning method itself, but helps people learning new things (like computer programs or starting new projects)\n3. Scaffolds can be virtual or real - teachers are scaffolds, and so is Microsoft Office's paperclip assistant\n4. Virtual scaffolds are built into software and ask questions, give hints, and provide information about processes that would be challenging for students to handle alone\n\n**Understanding scaffolding characteristics:**\nFrom the passage, scaffolds:\n- Help people learn new things\n- Provide support and guidance\n- Ask questions, give hints, and provide information\n- Assist with processes that are challenging to handle independently\n- Can be human (teachers) or virtual (software assistants)\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n1. **Computer game tutorial at the beginning** - This provides guidance and helps users learn new controls/mechanics. This IS a scaffold.\n\n2. **SAT tutor** - A tutor provides guidance, asks questions, gives hints, and helps with challenging processes. This IS a scaffold.\n\n3. **Independent study program** - This is self-directed learning without external support or guidance. Students work alone without scaffolding support. This is NOT a scaffold.\n\n4. **Little league coach** - A coach provides guidance, instruction, and support to help players learn and improve. This IS a scaffold.\n\nThe question asks which is NOT an example of scaffolding. Based on the definition provided in the passage, an independent study program lacks the supportive, guiding characteristics that define scaffolding.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this Hindi passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses the appeal of long-distance travel in one's own car. It mentions that unlike larger vehicles, people are usually already accustomed to driving their own cars and know their limitations. The passage also talks about how setting up tents on private property or in cities can attract unwanted attention. It explains that using your car for road trips is a great way to travel, and sometimes the car can also serve as a \"camp.\" Finally, it states that if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon with seats that can be folded down, then car camping is possible.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the given paragraph, what would be helpful for a car stay planner?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. Having good knowledge about the car and its limitations\n2. A vehicle with reclining/foldable seats\n3. Tent\n4. Should have private property for camping\n\n**Step 4: Finding the answer from the passage**\nThe passage mentions several key points:\n- People are already accustomed to driving their own cars and know their limitations\n- Setting up tents can attract unwanted attention\n- Cars can serve as camps themselves\n- Having a vehicle with seats that can be folded down makes car camping possible\n\nThe passage emphasizes that car camping is possible with vehicles that have foldable seats, which directly relates to what would be helpful for someone planning to stay in their car.\n\n**Step 5: Selecting the correct option**\nOption 2 (a vehicle with reclining/foldable seats) is most directly supported by the passage, as it specifically mentions that car camping is possible if you have a vehicle \"जिसमें सीटें नीचे की जा सकती हैं\" (in which seats can be folded down).\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses different types of tourism:\n\n1. **Recreational Tourism**: The most common type where people visit entertainment destinations for relaxation and fun, away from daily life. Examples given are beaches, theme parks, and campgrounds.\n\n2. **Cultural Tourism**: When a person's purpose for visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture. Tourists can visit various places in a specific country or focus on just one region.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"What type of tourism does visiting a museum fall under?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. Business tourism (व्यापार पर्यटन)\n2. Recreational tourism (मनोरंजक पर्यटन)\n3. Cultural tourism (सांस्कृतिक पर्यटन)\n4. Outdoor tourism (आउटडोर पर्यटन)\n\n**Step 4: Reasoning about museums**\nMuseums are institutions that preserve and display artifacts, art, historical objects, and cultural heritage. When people visit museums, their primary purpose is typically to:\n- Learn about history\n- Understand culture\n- Gain knowledge about art, science, or heritage\n- Explore the cultural significance of a place or civilization\n\n**Step 5: Matching with the passage definition**\nAccording to the passage, cultural tourism is defined as when \"a person's purpose for visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture.\" This perfectly matches what people do when they visit museums.\n\nMuseums are not primarily for entertainment/recreation (though they can be enjoyable), not for business purposes, and not specifically outdoor activities.\n\n3",

The question asks about a \"captive fighter's feast\" (कैप्टिव फाइटर का भोज), but the passage is entirely about a US Navy mine countermeasure ship and an incident involving it. There is no mention of:\n- Any captive fighter\n- Any feast or celebration\n- Any country planning such an event\n\n**Step 4: Examining the Options**\nThe options provided are:\n1. It was en route to Puerto Princesa\n2. It is located in Palawan\n3. It is a mine countermeasures ship\n4. Assigned to the American Navy's Seventh Fleet\n\nThese options are all factual statements about the ship mentioned in the passage, but none of them answer the question about a \"captive fighter's feast.\"\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThis appears to be a mismatched question-passage pair. The question doesn't relate to the content of the passage at all. However, since I must choose from the given options, I need to select the most relevant one related to the US Navy (America) since that's the only country mentioned in the passage.\n\n4",

Cabo da Roca - This is mentioned as a bus stop, not the reason for Sintra's fame\n2. Marian magic presence - This refers to the Fatima sanctuary, not Sintra\n3. Lord Byron's positive review - This matches what the passage says about Lord Byron documenting his magnificent exploits and making Sintra famous among foreigners\n4. It is a romantic epic - While Sintra is described as romantic, this doesn't explain how it gained recognition among foreigners\n\n**Step 4: Finding the correct answer**\nThe passage clearly states that Sintra \"was made famous among foreigners after Lord Byron documented his magnificent exploits there.\" This directly corresponds to option 3 about Lord Byron's positive review.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the passage**: This is about Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, winning the Florida Republican primary election on Tuesday with 46% of the vote.\n\n2. **Key information**: \n   - Mitt Romney won with 46% votes\n   - Newt Gingrich (former US House Speaker) came second with 32%\n   - Florida operates as a \"winner-takes-all\" state\n   - As the winner of all the state, Florida awarded all fifty of its delegates to Romney\n\n3. **Analyzing the question**: The question asks \"Since Florida was a winner-takes-all state, what was given to Mitt Romney?\"\n\n4. **Examining the options**:\n   - Option 1: \"32 delegates of the state\" - This is incorrect. 32% was Gingrich's vote share, not the number of delegates\n   - Option 2: \"Republican Party nomination\" - This is incorrect. The passage says this made him a strong contender for the nomination, but he didn't receive the actual nomination yet\n   - Option 3: \"All states' delegates\" - This is incorrect. He only received Florida's delegates, not all states'\n   - Option 4: \"46 percent votes\" - This is incorrect. The 46% votes were what he received to win, not what was given to him as a result of winning\n\n5. **Finding the correct answer**: The passage clearly states \"फ़्लोरिडा ने अपने सभी पचास प्रतिनिधियों को रोमनी को सम्मानित किए\" (Florida awarded all fifty of its delegates to Romney). While this exact phrasing isn't in the options, option 1 mentions delegates from the state, but with the wrong number (32 instead of 50).\n\nLooking more carefully, none of the options perfectly match what the passage says (50 delegates), but option 1 is closest as it mentions state delegates, even though the number is wrong.\n\nActually, re-reading the options, I need to be more precise. The passage says Florida gave Romney \"all fifty delegates,\" but none of the options say \"50 delegates\" or \"all delegates of Florida.\"\n\nWait, let me reconsider option",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage is about bow markings and techniques for string instruments (like violin). Let me break down what it says:\n\n1. \"Up bow\" symbol looks like a V\n2. \"Down bow\" symbol looks like a staple or like a square with the bottom part missing\n3. Up bow means you should start from the tip and push the bow\n4. Down bow means you should start from the frog (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow\n5. An up bow usually produces a soft/gentle sound\n6. A down bow is strong and more assertive/vocal\n7. You can write your own marks, but printed bowing marks exist for musical reasons and should generally be respected\n\nNow let me analyze what relates to \"bow pulling\" (धनुष खींचने):\n\nFrom the passage, bow pulling refers to the down bow technique, which:\n- Starts from the frog\n- Produces a strong and assertive sound\n- Has a symbol that looks like a staple\n\nThe question asks which of the following is NOT related to bow pulling:\n\n1. Soft sound (नरम ध्वनि) - This is associated with UP bow, not down bow (pulling)\n2. Mark like a tablet stimulation (निशान एक टैबलेट उत्तेजना की तरह होगा) - This seems to refer to the staple-like symbol of down bow\n3. Strong voice (मजबूत आवाज) - This IS associated with down bow (pulling)\n4. Starting from frog (मेंढक से शुरू) - This IS associated with down bow (pulling)\n\nThe soft sound is specifically mentioned as being produced by up bow, not down bow (pulling).\n\n1",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage describes Tropical Cyclone Gonu, which is named after a bag of palm leaves in Maldivian language. At its peak, it reached sustained winds of 240 kilometers per hour (149 mph). At the beginning of the day, the winds were about 83 km/h and it was expected to remain weak.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"According to the passage, when was Tropical Cyclone Gonu expected to weaken?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. Before reaching Maldives\n2. When wind speeds dropped to around 83 kilometers per hour\n3. Before reaching its peak\n4. Before reaching 149 mph wind speeds\n\n**Key information from the passage:**\n- At its peak: 240 km/h (149 mph) winds\n- At the beginning of the day: winds were about 83 km/h\n- It was expected to remain weak (कमज़ोर रहने की अपेक्षा थी)\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage states that at the beginning of the day, winds were around 83 km/h and \"it was expected to remain weak\" (इसके कमज़ोर रहने की अपेक्षा थी). This indicates that when the winds were at 83 km/h, the cyclone was expected to stay weak/weaken.\n\nThe passage describes a timeline where the cyclone started weak (83 km/h) but eventually reached its peak (240 km/h). The expectation of weakening was mentioned in relation to the early stage when winds were 83 km/h.\n\n2",

It mentions that:\n- Speed becomes less important in these distances\n- Stability/endurance becomes extremely necessary\n- A first-class half-mile runner (who can complete it in under 2 minutes) should have considerable speed\n- But endurance development is essential for all challenges\n- Winter cross-country running combined with gym work for upper body strength is the best preparation for running season\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the given passage, which of the following is extremely important for a first-class half-mile runner?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. Running some cross-country in winter\n2. Developing endurance instead of speed\n3. Winning in two minutes\n4. Developing speed instead of endurance\n\n**Step 4: Finding the correct answer**\nThe passage clearly states:\n- \"गति बहुत कम महत्व की हो जाती है और स्थिरता एक अत्यंत आवश्यकता बन जाती है\" (Speed becomes of very little importance and stability becomes an extreme necessity)\n- \"सभी खतरों के लिए सहन-शक्ति का विकास होना जरूरी है\" (Endurance development is necessary for all challenges)\n\nThe passage emphasizes that while speed is needed, endurance/stability is extremely important and necessary.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly indicates that endurance (धीरज/सहन-शक्ति) is more important than speed for half-mile runners.\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the \"protein problem\"**\nThe passage describes that in the savanna, plants available to primates with human-like digestive systems may be insufficient to meet their amino acid requirements. Failure to get adequate protein leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing plant-based protein sources**\nThe passage states that the most easily available plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes/beans. However, for primates like us, these are difficult to digest without cooking.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing animal-based protein sources**\nThe passage contrasts this with animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs), which are:\n- Easily digestible\n- Provide high amounts of protein\n- Contain all essential amino acids\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n1. Dried leaves - These are plant-based and would be difficult to digest without cooking\n2. Raw legumes/beans - These are specifically mentioned as difficult to digest without cooking\n3. Locusts/grasshoppers - These are insects (animal protein), similar to the ants and termites mentioned as good solutions\n4. Flower stems - These are plant-based and not mentioned as good protein sources\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly indicates that animal protein sources (like insects) are the solution to the \"protein problem\" because they are easily digestible and provide complete amino acids. Among the options, locusts/grasshoppers (option 3) are the only animal protein source that matches the solution described in the passage.\n\n3",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage explains how long-distance communication works using satellites. It describes that:\n- To call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites\n- The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down at the same time\n- Satellites are sent to space using rockets\n- Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision\n- Large rockets over 100 feet tall are needed to place satellites or telescopes in space\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the question**\nThe question asks: \"Which of the following options represents long-distance calls coming back to Earth?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the options**\n1. दूरबीन (Telescope) - Used for observation, not for calls\n2. उपग्रहों (Satellites) - The passage clearly states that satellites receive calls and reflect them back to Earth\n3. दीपक (Lamp/Light) - Not mentioned in the context of calls\n4. रॉकेट्स (Rockets) - Used to launch satellites, not for reflecting calls back\n\n**Step 4: Finding the correct answer**\nAccording to the passage, satellites are specifically described as receiving calls from space and reflecting them back down to Earth. The passage states: \"अंतरिक्ष में उपग्रह को कॉल मिलता है और फिर इसे वापस नीचे, उसी समय परावर्तित करता है\" (The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down at the same time).\n\n2",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses gravity on Io (one of Jupiter's moons) and how it would affect a person's weight compared to Earth. It states:\n- If you stand on Io's surface, your weight would be less than your weight on Earth\n- A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh approximately 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io\n- Therefore, gravity shows less attraction on you\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing what this means**\nThe passage clearly indicates that Io's gravitational force is weaker than Earth's gravitational force, since:\n- Weight is directly proportional to gravitational force\n- Lower weight on Io = weaker gravitational pull\n- The example shows weight reduction from 200 lbs to 36 lbs (about 18% of Earth weight)\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating each option**\n1. \"Io's gravitational force will pull you less than Earth's gravity\" - This matches the passage exactly\n2. \"The more Io's gravitational force, the less your weight becomes\" - This is contradictory and doesn't make sense\n3. \"When less gravitational force pulls more, your weight increases\" - This is illogical and contradicts physics\n4. \"Io's gravitational force will pull you more than Earth's gravity\" - This directly contradicts the passage\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly states that weight is less on Io, which means gravitational force is less. Option 1 correctly reflects this information.\n\n1",

If someone travels in summer instead of winter, the key difference would be that there would be less ice or no ice to pass through.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n1. Spending time in the city - This is mentioned as part of St. Petersburg cruise regardless of season\n2. Passing through ice - This is specifically mentioned as a winter issue that causes terrible noise\n3. Visa requirements - The passage states cruise passengers are exempted regardless of season\n4. St. Petersburg - This is a destination, not something to avoid\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nIn summer, there would be less ice in the Baltic Sea, so travelers would be able to avoid the issue of \"passing through ice\" that causes terrible noise in winter.\n\n2",

      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English:\n\n**Understanding the passage:**\nThe passage states that moose (also called elk) are not naturally aggressive, but they will defend themselves if they feel threatened. When people don't consider moose to be very dangerous, they may come too close and put themselves at risk.\n\n**Understanding the question:**\nThe question asks: \"What should people avoid doing with moose?\"\n\n**Analyzing the options:**\n1. \"Being unaware\" - This doesn't directly address the behavioral advice from the passage\n2. \"Coming slowly\" - This is about approach speed, but the passage suggests the problem is getting too close at all\n3. \"Underestimating their danger level\" - This directly matches the passage's warning that when people don't consider moose very dangerous, they come too close and risk themselves\n4. \"Watching them from a distance\" - This would actually be the recommended safe behavior, not something to avoid\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe passage clearly indicates that the problem occurs when people underestimate how dangerous moose can be. This leads them to approach too closely, which puts them in danger because moose will defend themselves when they feel threatened. Therefore, people should avoid underestimating the danger level of moose.\n\n3",

So advice about pollution was given.\n\n3. **A target date**: He mentioned 2020 as the target year for achieving the reduction from 2005 levels. So a date was mentioned.\n\n**What Hu did NOT mention:**\n\n4. **Specific figures for carbon emission reduction**: The passage explicitly states \"उन्होंने कटौती के लिए कोई आँकड़ा निर्धारित नहीं किया\" which means \"he did not set any specific figure for the reduction.\"\n\nThe question asks what was NOT mentioned by Hu. Based on my analysis, while he mentioned the basis, gave advice about pollution, and provided a target date, he specifically did not provide any concrete numbers or figures for the amount of carbon emission reduction.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English.\n\nThe passage describes Babylonian religious practices and temple structure:\n\n1. **Temple Structure**: Each temple had:\n   - An open courtyard\n   - An inner sanctuary (गर्भगृह) where only priests could enter\n   - Pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats with a special sanctuary at the top for the deity\n\n2. **Religious Activities**:\n   - People brought sacrifices/offerings to the gods\n   - Priests served the gods by dedicating time to ceremonies and festivals\n   - Only priests could enter the inner sanctuary\n\n3. **Access Restrictions**:\n   - The inner sanctuary was restricted to priests only\n   - The top of the tower had a special sanctuary for the deity\n\nNow let me analyze each option:\n\n1. **Bringing sacrifices in the temple courtyard** - This would be allowed since the courtyard was open and people brought offerings\n2. **Participating in ceremonies held in main temples** - This would be possible as people could attend festivals and ceremonies\n3. **Festivals held on the temple roof** - While not explicitly mentioned, this could be possible in accessible areas\n4. **Bringing sacrifices in the inner sanctuary** - This would NOT be possible because the passage clearly states that only priests could enter the inner sanctuary (आंतरिक गर्भगृह)\n\nThe question asks where an average Babylonian citizen could NOT be found. Based on the passage, ordinary citizens were prohibited from entering the inner sanctuary.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this Hindi passage step by step in English:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses what happens when a light bulb stops working and how to safely replace it. It explains that after hundreds of hours of operation, the bulb's filament burns out, causing the light bulb to stop working.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the specific question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the given paragraph, what is the reason for the light bulb to stop working?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing each option**\n1. \"The lamp's switch should be properly turned off\" - This is about safety precautions when replacing a bulb, not why it stops working.\n\n2. \"Electricity flows in the socket where the metal part of the lamp is located\" - This explains why there's a risk of electric shock, not why the bulb stops working.\n\n3. \"The fiber in the bulb burns\" - This refers to the filament burning out, which the passage clearly states as the reason the bulb stops working. (Note: \"fiber\" here refers to the filament)\n\n4. \"Less electricity flows in the socket\" - This is not mentioned in the passage as a reason for bulb failure.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the correct answer**\nThe passage clearly states: \"सैकड़ों घंटे तक कार्य करने के बाद बल्ब का फिलामेंट जल जाता है और इसके बाद लाइट बल्ब काम नहीं करता\" (After working for hundreds of hours, the bulb's filament burns out and after that the light bulb doesn't work).\n\nThis directly corresponds to option 3, which mentions the fiber/filament burning in the bulb.\n\n3",

There were light morning showers that ended quickly, making it a great day for 7s rugby.\n\n**Step 2: Key information about South Africa's performance**\n- South Africa was the top seed in the tournament\n- They had an easy 26-0 victory against 5th-seeded Zambia\n- Initially, they appeared decisively weak against their \"Southern Sisters\" (likely referring to another team)\n- However, South Africa showed improvement as the tournament progressed\n- Their disciplined defense, bowling skills, and good teamwork made them stand out\n- It became clear that this team would be competitive\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"According to the passage, when did South Africa's improvement in the game begin?\"\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n1. \"Around 10:00 AM in the morning\" - This is when the game started, not when improvement began\n2. \"After tightening their defense\" - The passage mentions disciplined defense as part of their improvement, but doesn't say improvement started after defense tightening\n3. \"After losing to Zambia\" - This is incorrect; South Africa won against Zambia 26-0\n4. \"As the tournament was progressing\" - This matches the passage which states \"फिर भी लगातार दक्षिण अफ़्रीका ने टूर्नामेंट के आगे बढ़ने पर सुधार किया है\" (Nevertheless, South Africa continuously improved as the tournament progressed)\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe passage clearly states that South Africa showed improvement as the tournament progressed, despite initially appearing weak.\n\n4",
      "Let me analyze this passage step by step in English:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the passage content**\nThe passage discusses genetic variation research from the 20th century. It explains that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden (छुपा हुआ) and expressed (अभिव्यक्त).\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the key processes mentioned**\nThe passage mentions several genetic processes:\n- Mutation (उत्परिवर्तन) - adds new genetic variation\n- Selection (चयन) - removes variation from the expressed pool\n- Isolation (अलगाव) and recombination (पुनर्संयोजन) - move variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the question**\nThe question asks: \"Which process is responsible for adding genetic differences/variation?\"\n\n**Step 4: Matching the question with passage information**\nAccording to the passage, it clearly states: \"उत्परिवर्तन नई आनुवंशिक भिन्नता जोड़ता है\" which translates to \"Mutation adds new genetic variation.\"\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the options**\n1. पृथक्करण (Isolation) - moves variation between pools, doesn't add new variation\n2. पुनर्संयोजन (Recombination) - moves variation between pools, doesn't add new variation\n3. उत्परिवर्तन (Mutation) - explicitly stated as adding new genetic variation\n4. अभिव्यक्त (Expressed) - this is a type of variation pool, not a process\n\nThe passage explicitly states that mutation is responsible for adding new genetic variation.\n\n3",
