      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Beijing, China will become the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics, and this city will thus become the first city to have hosted both Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Beijing will host the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor skating events. Other skiing activities will be held at the Taizicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 kilometers (140 miles) from Beijing.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which of the following will NOT be held in Beijing during the 2022 Olympics?\n\nOptions:\n1. Opening ceremony\n2. Taizicheng Ski Resort competitions\n3. Closing ceremony\n4. Indoor skating events\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, Beijing will host the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor skating events. However, the skiing activities will be held at Taizicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 kilometers away from Beijing. Therefore, the Taizicheng Ski Resort competitions will not be held in Beijing.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences. Virtual team members often serve as contact points for their corresponding offline teams. They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may schedule meetings for different time zones, which local management may not understand. The existence of truly \"invisible teams\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams. \"Invisible teams\" refer to the management teams that each member reports to. They set standards for all members.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, what similarities exist between traditional teams and virtual teams?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Both types of teams are expected to have the same level of work performance\n2. Both types of teams have different degrees of autonomy in their daily work\n3. Both types of teams report to invisible management teams\n4. Both types of teams operate in the same time zone\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage states that \"Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams,\" which indicates that both types of teams are expected to maintain the same level of work performance and quality standards.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** This traditional medieval castle has long inspired people's imagination, evoking images of jousting on horseback, banquets, and the chivalric spirit of King Arthur's knights. Even when standing among thousand-year-old ruins, people can easily recall the sounds and smells of long-past wars, almost hearing the clash of horse hooves on cobblestones and smelling the breath of fear rising from dungeon pits. But does our imagination have a basis in reality? Why were castles originally built? How were they designed and constructed?\n\n**Question:** Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the text as something possibly related to medieval castles?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Dungeon pits\n2. Jousting on horseback\n3. Chivalric spirit\n4. Knights\n\n**Analysis:**\nLooking at each option:\n1. Dungeon pits (地牢坑) - mentioned in the passage: \"smelling the breath of fear rising from dungeon pits\"\n2. Jousting on horseback (马背长矛比武) - mentioned in the passage: \"evoking images of jousting on horseback\"\n3. Chivalric spirit (骑士精神) - mentioned in the passage: \"the chivalric spirit of King Arthur's knights\"\n4. Knights (骑士) - mentioned in the passage: \"King Arthur's knights\"\n\nWait, let me recheck this carefully. The passage mentions:\n- 马背长矛比武 (jousting on horseback) ✓\n- 骑士精神 (chivalric spirit) ✓  \n- 地牢坑 (dungeon pits) ✓\n- 亚瑟王骑士 (King Arthur's knights) - this mentions knights ✓\n\nAll four items are actually mentioned in the text. Let me read more carefully...\n\nActually, upon closer examination, all options are mentioned in the passage. However, looking at the specific wording, \"骑士\" (knights) as a standalone term is mentioned as part of \"亚瑟王骑士\" (King Arthur's knights), while the other three are mentioned more directly as standalone concepts.\n\nBut reviewing again, all four options are clearly present in the",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is just a general term that encompasses various local cuisines from across the country. However, without additional qualifiers, this term often refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java. Now, Javanese cuisine can be eaten everywhere throughout the archipelago, including many dishes with simple seasoning methods, and the main seasonings that Javanese people prefer include peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is mainly used in Javanese cuisine?\n\nOptions:\n1. White sugar\n2. Powdered sugar\n3. Coconut sugar\n4. Brown sugar\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage specifically mentions that Javanese people prefer sugar, \"especially Javanese coconut sugar\" (尤其是爪哇椰子糖) as one of their main seasonings.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: \"Because passengers were waiting in 90-degree (F) high temperatures, they were able to receive distributed water. Fire Chief Scott Kuhns said: 'Santa Clara was very hot that day, with temperatures reaching over 90 degrees Fahrenheit.' Every minute and second trapped on the roller coaster was uncomfortable, and it's no exaggeration to say that it took us at least an hour to rescue the first person from the roller coaster.\"\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, who made comments about the uncomfortably high temperatures?\n\nOptions:\n1. Roller coaster operator\n2. Fire chief\n3. Passengers\n4. Police chief\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that Fire Chief Scott Kuhns made comments about the high temperatures, saying \"Santa Clara was very hot that day, with temperatures reaching over 90 degrees Fahrenheit\" and describing how uncomfortable it was for people trapped on the roller coaster.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Stars emit light and heat because energy is produced when hydrogen atoms combine (or fuse) together to form heavier elements. Scientists are currently working to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way. However, this is a very difficult problem to solve. It will take many years before we can see practical fusion reactors built.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, what does fusion enable stars to do?\n\nOptions:\n1. Form heavier elements\n2. Build fusion reactors\n3. Emit light and heat\n4. Produce hydrogen atoms\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, stars emit light and heat because energy is produced when hydrogen atoms fuse together to form heavier elements. The fusion process is what enables stars to emit light and heat.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Traditionally, heirs to the throne would directly enlist in the military after completing their studies. However, Charles enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later studied history, obtaining a 2:2 degree (second-class second division). Charles was the first British royal family member to obtain a degree.\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided in the text, Charles was the first British royal family member to do what?\n\nOptions:\n1. Enlist in the military before completing his studies\n2. Study archaeology\n3. Obtain a degree\n4. Enroll at Trinity College\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage explicitly states that \"Charles was the first British royal family member to obtain a degree.\" This directly answers the question about what Charles was the first royal family member to do.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolded learning goes even further. Scaffolded instruction is not a learning method, but rather a means of assisting people who are just learning to use new computer programs or starting new projects. Scaffolded instruction can be conducted online or offline. In other words, teachers are a form of scaffolded instruction, just like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office. Virtual support is built into software to question, prompt, and explain procedures that might be difficult for students to handle independently.\n\n**Question:** Based on the information in this passage, which is NOT an example of scaffolded instruction?\n\n**Options:**\n1. A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game\n2. An SAT tutor\n3. An independent study plan\n4. A little league coach\n\n**Analysis:**\nAccording to the passage, scaffolded instruction is a means of assisting people who are learning new programs or starting new projects. It involves questioning, prompting, and explaining procedures that students might find difficult to handle alone. \n\nLooking at the options:\n1. A computer game tutorial - provides guidance and assistance when learning something new\n2. An SAT tutor - provides support and guidance to students\n3. An independent study plan - this is something a student follows on their own without assistance or support\n4. A little league coach - provides guidance and instruction to players learning the sport\n\nAn independent study plan is designed for students to work alone without external assistance, which contradicts the concept of scaffolded instruction that emphasizes providing support and assistance.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Food and accommodation exchange networks are organizations that connect travelers with local residents in their destination cities. Joining such organizations usually only requires filling out an online form; although some organizations provide or require additional verification. Subsequently, a paper and/or online list is provided that lists hosts who still have available rooms, sometimes marked with recommendations and review information from other travelers. Couchsurfing was established in January 2004. Before that, computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but had no accommodation. After he sent emails to local university students, invitations offering free accommodation came flooding in.\n\n**Question:** What is provided to travelers through food and accommodation exchange networks?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Accommodation with local hosts\n2. Cheap flights\n3. Tourist activities provided by local guides\n4. Connection with other travelers going to the same destination\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the passage, food and accommodation exchange networks connect travelers with local residents and provide lists of hosts who have available rooms. The passage specifically mentions that these networks list \"房东\" (hosts/landlords) who have spare rooms available for travelers.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Perhaps the most common type of tourism, and what most people think of when they think of travel: leisure tourism. This refers to people going to a place that is completely different from their daily life for relaxation and entertainment. Beaches, theme parks, and camping sites are usually the places most frequently visited by leisure tourists. If a person visits a specific place with the purpose of understanding its history and culture, then this type of tourism activity is called cultural tourism. Tourists may visit different landmarks in a specific country, or may focus on touring just one region.\n\n**Question:** Visiting museums belongs to which of the following tourism categories?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Business tourism\n2. Leisure tourism\n3. Cultural tourism\n4. Outdoor tourism\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the passage, cultural tourism is defined as visiting a place \"with the purpose of understanding its history and culture.\" Museums are institutions that preserve and display historical artifacts, cultural heritage, and educational exhibits. Therefore, visiting museums clearly falls under cultural tourism as it involves learning about history and culture.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The shock of returning home comes faster than culture shock (with a shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and may be more severe. For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes difficult to readjust to their native culture. After living abroad for a period of time and returning home, you will find that you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits of your home culture. When you first go abroad, people may be very patient and understanding with you because they know that travelers need to adapt when coming to a new country. People may not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding on their return journey.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, which type of traveler might have more difficulty adapting to the shock of returning home?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Travelers who experienced particularly bad culture shock\n2. Travelers who could quickly adapt while living abroad\n3. Travelers who are still in the honeymoon period\n4. Travelers who lack patience\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that \"For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes difficult to readjust to their native culture.\" This directly indicates that travelers who can quickly adapt while living abroad are the ones who may have more difficulty with reverse culture shock when returning home.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Throwing boomerangs is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn. If you want to learn to throw a boomerang and have it fly back to your hand after throwing it out, you must use a suitable boomerang that can fly back. In fact, most boomerangs available in the Australian market cannot fly back. Beginners should not attempt to throw boomerangs in strong winds.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, which of the following statements accurately describes boomerang throwing?\n\n**Options:**\n1. If thrown correctly, it will always return to your hand\n2. It is more popular among locals than among tourists\n3. There are not many boomerangs available in Australia\n4. Only some boomerangs are able to return\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage clearly states that \"most boomerangs available in the Australian market cannot fly back,\" which means only some boomerangs can return. This directly supports option 4. Option 1 is incorrect because the passage emphasizes you need the right type of boomerang, not just correct throwing technique. Option 2 contradicts the passage which says it's popular among tourists. Option 3 misinterprets the passage - it's not about quantity available, but about the type that can return.\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** In the Rugby Union Tri-Nations match held at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, South Africa, the South African team defeated the All Blacks (New Zealand). The final result was a narrow one-point victory with a score of 21 to 20, ending the All Blacks' 15-game winning streak. The Springboks concluded with five consecutive defeats. The All Blacks had already won the trophy two weeks ago, and this match was their last game. The final match of the series will be held next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where the Springboks will face Australia.\n\n**Question:** Which teams will participate in the match at Ellis Park?\n\n**Options:**\n1. All Blacks and Australia\n2. New Zealand and South Africa\n3. South Africa and Australia\n4. Springboks and All Blacks\n\n**Answer:**\nAccording to the passage, the final match of the series will be held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where the Springboks (South Africa) will face Australia. Therefore, the teams participating will be South Africa and Australia.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: \"The 'up bow' symbol looks like the letter V, and the 'down bow' symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom edge. Up bow refers to pushing the bow starting from the tip, while down bow refers to pulling the bow starting from the frog (which is where the hand grips the bow). Up bow usually produces a softer sound, while down bow produces a stronger, more assertive sound. Feel free to make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed notes have musical meaning, so they should generally be respected.\"\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which of the following is unrelated to down bow?\n\nOptions:\n1. Softer sound\n2. Symbol that looks like a staple\n3. Stronger sound\n4. Starting from the frog\n\n**Analysis:**\nAccording to the passage:\n- Down bow symbol looks like a staple (option 2) ✓\n- Down bow produces stronger sound (option 3) ✓  \n- Down bow starts from the frog (option 4) ✓\n- Softer sound is associated with up bow, not down bow (option 1) ✗\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to the new interim electoral committee (CEP) composed of 9 members. This is the fifth time in four years that Martelly has been selected for Haiti's interim electoral committee (CEP). Last month, the presidential council recommended that the former CEP resign, which was part of measures to push the country toward new elections. This committee was Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October. Since 2011, these protests have been triggered by some elections failing to be held as scheduled, and sometimes the protests escalate to violence.\n\nQuestion: Who recommended that the last CEP resign?\n\nOptions:\n1. Martelly\n2. Protesters\n3. Presidential council\n4. CEP members recommended their own resignation\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, \"Last month, the presidential council recommended that the former CEP resign\" (上个月，总统委员会建议前任 CEP 辞职). This clearly states that it was the presidential council who made the recommendation for the former CEP to resign.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: The first batch of cases this season was reported in late July. Pigs carry the disease, which is then transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. This outbreak prompted the Indian government to take some measures, such as placing pig traps in severely infected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying insecticides. The government also promised to provide millions of doses of encephalitis vaccines, which will help medical institutions prepare for next year. Due to lack of funding and lower priority compared to other diseases, this year's plan to provide vaccines to historically most severely affected areas has been postponed.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which epidemic prevention measure will be implemented last?\n\nOptions:\n1. Insecticides\n2. Pig traps\n3. Encephalitis vaccines\n4. Mosquito nets\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage mentions that pig traps, mosquito nets, and insecticides are current measures being implemented. However, the encephalitis vaccines are described as being promised for \"next year\" and the plan for this year has been \"postponed\" due to lack of funding and lower priority. This indicates that the vaccines will be implemented last.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Proper nutritional practices alone are not sufficient to create outstanding performance, but they can significantly impact the overall health of young athletes. Maintaining a healthy energy balance, adhering to effective hydration habits, and understanding all aspects of the reasonable use of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sports.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, which of the following is NOT a suggestion for young athletes to find more enjoyment in sports?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Practice proper nutrition\n2. Always maintain outstanding performance\n3. Effective hydration\n4. Maintain healthy energy balance\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLooking at the passage, it mentions that proper nutrition, maintaining healthy energy balance, effective hydration habits, and understanding nutritional supplements can help athletes improve performance and increase enjoyment. However, the passage explicitly states that \"proper nutritional practices alone are not sufficient to create outstanding performance\" - meaning that always maintaining outstanding performance is not presented as a suggestion or something that can be easily achieved through these practices. The passage focuses on health and gradual improvement rather than demanding constant outstanding performance.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: When transitioning from a quarter-mile to a half-mile race, speed becomes less important, and endurance becomes an absolutely crucial factor. Of course, to become a first-class half-mile runner (completing the run within two minutes), one must have sufficient speed and must cultivate endurance at all costs. Practicing cross-country running in winter, combined with upper body fitness training, can provide adequate preparation for the running season.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which of the following is most important for a first-class half-mile runner?\n\nOptions:\n1. Practicing cross-country running in winter\n2. Cultivating endurance rather than speed\n3. Completing the run within two minutes\n4. Cultivating speed rather than endurance\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe passage states that for half-mile races, \"endurance becomes an absolutely crucial factor\" and that to be a first-class half-mile runner, one \"must cultivate endurance at all costs.\" While the passage mentions that sufficient speed is also needed, it emphasizes that endurance is the \"absolutely crucial factor\" and becomes more important than speed when transitioning from quarter-mile to half-mile races.\n\nOption 1 is just one training method mentioned, not the most important factor.\nOption 3 describes a performance standard, not what's most important to achieve it.\nOption 4 contradicts the passage, which clearly states endurance becomes more important than speed.\nOption 2 correctly identifies that cultivating endurance (rather than speed) is most important, which aligns with the passage's emphasis.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** On tropical grasslands, primates have digestive systems similar to humans, and existing plant resources can hardly meet primates' needs for amino acids. Furthermore, if this cannot be achieved, it will bring serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death. The most easily obtainable plant resources should be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting such proteins unless they are cooked. In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide abundant protein containing all essential amino acids. In summary, if our ancestors solved the \"protein problem\" in the same way as chimpanzees on tropical grasslands do today, we should not be surprised.\n\n**Question:** According to the information in the text, what kind of food should primates eat to solve the \"protein problem\"?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Withered leaves\n2. Raw legumes\n3. Grasshoppers\n4. Flower stems\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the passage, the text clearly states that animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide abundant protein with all essential amino acids, while plant proteins from leaves and legumes are difficult for primates to digest unless cooked. Among the given options, grasshoppers are the only animal food mentioned, which aligns with the passage's recommendation for solving the protein problem.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use satellites. Satellites in space receive the phone call and almost immediately reflect it back. Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere causes certain light and vision to become distorted.

Telescope\n2. Satellite\n3. Light\n4. Rocket\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that \"Satellites in space receive the phone call and almost immediately reflect it back.\" This directly answers the question about what reflects long-distance phone calls back to Earth.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** What kind of force would Io's gravity exert on me? If you stood on Io's surface, you would weigh less than on Earth. A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kilograms) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kilograms) on Io. Therefore, gravity naturally exerts a smaller pull on you.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, which of the following is an accurate statement about Io's gravity?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Earth has less gravitational pull on you than Io\n2. Io's gravitational pull is greater, which is why you would be lighter\n3. Io's gravitational pull is greater, which is why you would be heavier\n4. Earth has greater gravitational pull on you than Io\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage clearly states that if you stand on Io's surface, you would weigh less than on Earth (200 pounds on Earth vs. 36 pounds on Io), and that gravity \"naturally exerts a smaller pull on you\" on Io. This means Earth's gravitational pull is stronger than Io's gravitational pull.\n\n4",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** As a typical building of that period, Kirby Muxloe Castle was more of a fortified house than a true castle. Its large glass windows and thin walls could not possibly withstand a determined attack for long. In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began building this castle, the country was relatively peaceful, requiring only defense against small groups of wandering raiders.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following is an accurate description of Kirby Muxloe Castle?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The castle's thick walls were built at Lord Hastings' request\n2. Due to the peaceful nature of the country at the time, it required minimal fortifications\n3. The castle's construction did not conform to the typical style of the time\n4. It was built to withstand long, determined attacks\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLooking at each option:\n\n1. This contradicts the passage, which states the castle had \"thin walls,\" not thick walls.\n\n2. This aligns with the passage, which states the country was \"relatively peaceful\" and only needed defense against \"small groups of wandering raiders,\" indicating minimal fortification needs.\n\n3. This contradicts the passage, which describes it as \"a typical building of that period.\"\n\n4.

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Triceratops' teeth could not only bite through leaves, but also bite through very hard branches and roots. Some scientists believe that Triceratops fed on cycads, which were a very common plant during the Cretaceous period. These plants looked like small palm trees, with crowns made up of sharp, nail-like leaves. Before eating the trunk, Triceratops would use its powerful beak to strip away the leaves. Other scientists believe these plants were poisonous, so dinosaurs were unlikely to eat them, even though nowadays sloths and other animals like parrots (descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which part of the cycad plant might Triceratops have eaten?\n\nOptions:\n1. Nail-like leaves\n2. Trunk\n3. Roots\n4. Fruits\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, it states that \"Before eating the trunk, Triceratops would use its powerful beak to strip away the leaves.\" This clearly indicates that Triceratops would eat the trunk of the cycad plant after removing the leaves.\n\n2",

In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo. The volcanic lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center. Although Goma is relatively safe, traveling anywhere outside of Goma should be investigated beforehand to understand whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province has subsided. This city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla tracking programs. You can tour Goma by taking boda-boda (rental motorcycles). The normal (local) price for short trips is 500 Congolese francs.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following is NOT good advice for tourists visiting Goma?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The fighting in North Kivu is interesting\n2. It's a good place for cheap mountain gorilla tracking\n3. Rental motorcycles are a good means of transportation\n4. The base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo is located in the city\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage warns that travelers should investigate the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province before going outside Goma, indicating it's a safety concern, not something \"interesting\" for tourists.

Basically, they can be divided into two categories: either work while traveling, or minimize expenses as much as possible. This article focuses on the latter. For those tourists who are willing to sacrifice comfort and time, enjoy travel full of surprises, and reduce expenses to close to zero, please refer to \"The Ultimate Budget Travel Guide.\" This assumption presumes that travelers will not engage in theft, illegal trespassing, participation in illegal markets, begging, or exploiting others for personal gain.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, for whom might traveling on an extremely limited budget be relatively difficult?\n\n**Options:**\n1. People who like to accept challenges\n2. People who don't have strict time constraints\n3. People who plan to work remotely during travel\n4. People who like to follow itineraries\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage mentions that budget travel requires people who are \"willing to sacrifice comfort and time\" and \"enjoy travel full of surprises.\" This suggests that people who prefer structured, predictable travel experiences (like following strict itineraries) would find extremely budget travel difficult, as budget travel involves uncertainty and surprises rather than planned schedules.\n\n4",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Time is all around us, affecting everything we do, but it is very difficult to understand. For thousands of years, time has been the subject of study for religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars. The time we experience is a series of events that flow from the future to the present and then to the past. Time is also the way we use to compare the duration (length) of events.

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Avalanches are not abnormal phenomena; steep slopes can only accommodate a limited amount of snow, and excess snow will fall in the form of avalanches. The problem is that snow has strong adhesive properties. Therefore, some triggering factors are needed to cause snowfall, and a little bit of snow falling down may also trigger other snow to descend. Sometimes the initial trigger is the sun warming the snow, sometimes it's because of additional snowfall, sometimes it's due to other natural events, but more commonly the cause is often human factors.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a triggering factor for avalanches?\n\nOptions:\n1. Sticky snow\n2. Humans\n3. Sunlight\n4. Additional snowfall\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nAccording to the passage, the triggering factors for avalanches mentioned are:\n- Sun warming the snow (sunlight)\n- Additional snowfall\n- Human factors\n- Other natural events\n\nThe passage states that snow has strong adhesive/sticky properties, but this is described as a characteristic that actually prevents avalanches (requiring triggering factors to overcome this stickiness), not as a triggering factor itself.\n\n1",

When replacing the bulb, you must operate carefully. First, be sure to turn off the switch of the lighting fixture or disconnect the cable connection. This is because when the bulb is still partially connected to the socket, when you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb, current will flow into the socket (at the connection point of the bulb's metal base), causing you to receive a serious electric shock.\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, what ultimately causes the light bulb to stop working?\n\nOptions:\n1. The lighting fixture is not properly turned off\n2. The metal base of the bulb is only partially inserted into the socket\n3. The filament inside the bulb burns out\n4. The flow of current into the socket slows down\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states in the first sentence that \"After using for several hundred hours, the filament is eventually burned out, and the light bulb no longer lights up.\" This directly identifies the cause of the bulb stopping working as the filament burning out.\n\n3",

Wrap-around clothing\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage mentions that monasteries provide skirts, long pants, and wrap-around clothing for visitors who don't meet the dress code requirements. However, shorts would not be provided because they don't cover the knees, which violates the monastery's dress code that requires both men and women to have their knees covered.\n\n2",

The passage mentions he was born in Zagreb but doesn't say he played for a Zagreb team before Partizan.\n3. The passage says he played until 1958, not until before 1995.\n4. The passage says he \"became famous while playing for Belgrade Partizan\" and separately mentions he was elected best player in 1995, but doesn't say the election caused his fame.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** When children are still young, they can become aware of race and racial stereotypes, and these racial stereotypes will influence their behavior.

The minority ethnicity they choose to identify with\n2. Their behavior\n3. Their relationships with other children\n4. Their definition of race\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that racial stereotypes \"会影响其行为\" (will influence their behavior) and provides a specific example of how children's awareness of stereotypes about their ethnic group affects their academic performance, which is a form of behavior. The passage directly mentions that these stereotypes influence children's behavior.\n\n2",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa. Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common. Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity cause it to feel colder than what the thermometer shows. There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.\n\n**Question:** According to the passage, when should travelers visit Montevideo if they want to avoid wind?\n\n**Options:**\n1. During the winter months in the northern hemisphere\n2. During the dry season in Montevideo\n3. During the summer months in the northern hemisphere\n4. During the winter months in Montevideo\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage states that during Montevideo's winter, \"wind and humidity cause it to feel colder than what the thermometer shows,\" indicating that winter is particularly windy. Since Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere, when it's winter in the northern hemisphere (option 1), it's summer in Montevideo. When it's summer in the northern hemisphere (option 3), it's winter in Montevideo. To avoid wind, travelers should visit during Montevideo's summer, which corresponds to winter in the northern hemisphere. Option 2 is not applicable since the passage states there are no distinct dry seasons.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The Amazon is the second-longest and most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river. The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes up to six miles wide. A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon. The main Amazon stream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It takes in water from thousands of smaller rivers.\n\n**Question:** What does NOT apply to the Amazon?\n\n**Options:**\n1. It is the second-longest river\n2. It is the largest river\n3. It is the longest river\n4. It is the widest river\n\n**Analysis:**\nAccording to the passage:\n- The Amazon IS the second-longest river (option 1 is true)\n- The Amazon IS the most water-rich/largest river by volume (option 2 is true)\n- The Amazon is NOT the longest river - it's the second-longest (option 3 is false)\n- The Amazon IS the widest river (option 4 is true)\n\nThe question asks what does NOT apply to the Amazon, so the correct answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Especially in summer, you must be careful of mosquitoes if you want to hike through the rainforest.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga. In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love. With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations. At the center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them. Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty. Fortunately, drivers tend to behave somewhat consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically. To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed. These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating roadside facilities.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following options is used to mathematically represent a traffic flow?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Road operation\n2. Driver behavior\n3. Road design\n4. Traffic density\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage states that to better represent traffic flow mathematically, the relationships between three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed. Among the given options, \"traffic density\" (Verkehrsdichte) corresponds to one of these three main characteristics used in the mathematical representation of traffic flow.\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** There are many theories about the origins of Sanskrit. One of them is about the immigration of the Aryans from the west to India, who brought their language with them. Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe. The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the collection of the Upanishads, Sanskrit retreated for hierarchical reasons. Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that served as a source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages like French and Spanish.\n\n**Question:** According to the passage, for what reason did Sanskrit retreat?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Complexity\n2. Aryan migration\n3. Latin languages\n4. Hierarchy\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage explicitly states \"Nach der Sammlung der Upanishaden wich das Sanskrit aus hierarchischen Gründen zurück\" (After the collection of the Upanishads, Sanskrit retreated for hierarchical reasons).\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different eras. Each time period in China and each family that was in power was its own dynasty. Between the individual dynasties, there were also unstable times of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties. During these times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne. The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following epochs was, according to the passage, one of the bloodiest in China?\n\n**Options:**\n1.

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Goats were apparently already domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran. Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them as livestock in order to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and hide. Domestic goats were normally kept in herds that wandered around on hills or other pasture areas. The goats were tended by goatherds, quite similar to the better-known shepherds; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.\n\nQuestion: What was NOT a reason why goats were kept in ancient cultures?\n\nOptions:\n1. Supply of meat\n2. Help with grazing the land\n3. They provided companionship\n4. Supply of milk\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage states that ancient cultures kept goats \"um leicht an deren Milch, Fell, Fleisch und Haut zu kommen\" (to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and hide). The passage mentions milk (option 4), meat (option 1), but does not mention that goats were kept for companionship (option 3) or to help with grazing the land (option 2). However, option 2 could be interpreted as related to the grazing practices mentioned, while option 3 (companionship) is clearly not mentioned as a reason for keeping goats.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Reverse culture shock comes earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more severe. Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their home culture. When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to another culture and abandoned some behaviors of your home culture. When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt in a new country. One might not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary toward returning travelers.\n\nQuestion: What do travelers with reverse culture shock find difficult?\n\nOptions:\n1. Adapting to the culture of a new place\n2. Being patient and understanding\n3. Traveling abroad\n4. Readjusting to their home culture\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that travelers who experienced reverse culture shock find it difficult to readjust to their home culture after having adapted to a foreign culture during their stay abroad. The text specifically mentions that \"travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their home culture.\"\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons. Roughly like when you roll a heavy wagon up a hill. When the nucleus is split again, part of this energy is released. Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they decay with little or even no impulse.\n\nQuestion: According to the passage, what happens when an atomic nucleus is split?\n\nOptions:\n1. Protons are gained\n2. Energy is released\n3. Atoms become unstable\n4. Neutrons are lost\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, when a nucleus is split again, \"part of this energy is released\" (ein Teil dieser Energie freigesetzt). This directly corresponds to option 2.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The heritage of some hotels reaches back to the golden age of steam railways and ocean liners, the time before the Second World War, the 19th or early 20th century. In these hotels, the rich and famous of their time used to stay overnight and enjoy good food and nightlife. The antique furnishings, the absence of modern conveniences, and a certain elegant aging also make up their character. Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes accommodate heads of state and other dignitaries who are visiting. Very wealthy travelers might choose a flight around the world that alternates with visits to many of these hotels.\n\n**Question:** Which offerings are least emphasized for hotel guests according to the information in the passage?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Antique furnishings in the house\n2. A restaurant with an excellent chef\n3. A lounge with evening entertainment\n4.

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: This in combination with its relative inaccessibility has made \"Timbuktu\" a metaphor for exotic, distant countries. Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, it is nowadays an impoverished city. In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat from desert sand. It was one of the important stations of Louis Gates' PBS special \"Wonders of the African World.\" The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.\n\nQuestion: Which description does not apply to Timbuktu?\n\nOptions:\n1. The city has more of an Arabic flair than the rest of the country\n2. The city is impoverished\n3. The city is not reachable by airplane\n4. The city is still an attraction for curious tourists\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLooking at each option against the passage:\n\n1. The passage states the city \"has more of an Arabic than an African flair\" compared to other cities in the country - this is TRUE.\n\n2. The passage explicitly states \"it is nowadays an impoverished city\" - this is TRUE.\n\n3. The passage mentions that Timbuktu \"has an airport\" - this means it IS reachable by airplane, making this statement FALSE.\n\n4. The passage states \"Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation\" - this is TRUE.\n\nThe question asks which description does NOT apply to Timbuktu, so the answer is option 3.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Buses depart all day from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30. Since buses between districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance. Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses that are comfortable and stable. Shared taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).\n\n**Question:** According to the passage, which situation would be ideal for travelers who want to take a bus from the inter-district bus station?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Travelers heading to Jakar who have already bought a ticket\n2. Travelers heading to Bumthang who must depart by 7 o'clock\n3. Travelers heading to Paro who must depart after 11 o'clock\n4. Travelers heading east who arrive at the station before 6:20\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the passage, the ideal situation would be travelers heading to Jakar who have already bought a ticket.

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: With the comments that were made live on television, high-ranking Iranian sources admitted for the first time that the sanctions are having an effect. These include financial restrictions and a ban by the European Union on the export of crude oil, from which the Iranian economy derives 80% of its foreign income. In their latest monthly report, OPEC said that crude oil exports have fallen to their lowest level in two decades, to 2.8 million barrels per day.

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy. The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way. Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius galaxy. The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter. This theory states that most of the dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.\n\nQuestion: Scientists working on the program hope to find effects of what?\n\nOptions:\n1. Normal matter\n2. Tides\n3. Small particles\n4. Dark matter\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that \"The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.\" The scientists are specifically studying the effects of dark matter and how it interacts with other dark matter through tidal forces.\n\n4",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, \"scaffolding\" goes one step further. Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or when beginning a new project. Scaffolds can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little paperclip character in Microsoft Office. Virtual aids are built into software and are meant to question, suggest, and explain work steps that the student might not be able to manage alone.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following examples is NOT a scaffold according to the information in the passage?\n\n**Options:**\n1. A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game\n2. A SAT tutor\n3. An independent learning program\n4. A small league coach\n\n**Analysis:**\nAccording to the passage, scaffolding is an aid that supports individuals in novel learning situations. The key characteristic is that it provides support and guidance when learners encounter something new or challenging.\n\n- Option 1 (tutorial): Provides guidance for new users - this is scaffolding\n- Option 2 (SAT tutor): Provides support and guidance to students - this is scaffolding  \n- Option 3 (independent learning program): By definition, this is independent and doesn't provide the supportive guidance that characterizes scaffolding\n- Option 4 (coach): Provides support and guidance to players - this is scaffolding\n\n3",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Children develop racial awareness and racial stereotypes quite early, and these racial stereotypes affect behavior. For example, children who identify with an ethnic minority that is said to not perform well in school tend to do poorly in school once they become aware of the stereotype associated with their ethnicity.\n\n**Question:** According to the theory presented in the passage, what could happen to a child who identifies with a racial minority that is stereotyped for threatening behavior?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The child will try to avoid threatening behavior\n2. The child will be more likely to engage in threatening behavior\n3. The child will withdraw from social situations\n4.

They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management. The presence of a real \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team. The \"invisible team\" is the management team to which each of the members reports. It establishes the standards for each of them.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, how are conventional and virtual teams similar?\n\nOptions:\n1. They are both subject to the same performance expectations\n2. They both have a variable level of autonomy in their daily routine\n3. They both report to an invisible management team\n4. They both operate in the same time zone\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states in the first sentence that \"Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams.\" This directly indicates that both types of teams have the same performance expectations or standards of excellence.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n- Option 2: The passage indicates virtual teams have MORE autonomy, not that both have variable autonomy\n- Option 3: The \"invisible team\" is described as a unique element of virtual teams\n- Option 4: The passage mentions virtual teams work across different time zones, which is a difference, not a similarity\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The traditional medieval castle has long stimulated the imagination, evoking images of jousts, banquets, and Arthurian chivalry. Even in the midst of thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to recall the sounds and smells of distant battles, to almost hear the clatter of hooves on cobblestones and to feel fear rising from the dungeon pits. But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and constructed?\n\n**Question:** What does the excerpt not mention as being something that could be associated with medieval castles?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The dungeon pits\n2. Jousts\n3. Chivalry\n4. Knights\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLooking at what is mentioned in the passage:\n- \"fosses du donjon\" (dungeon pits) - mentioned\n- \"joutes\" (jousts) - mentioned\n- \"chevalerie arthurienne\" (Arthurian chivalry) - mentioned\n- \"chevaliers\" (knights) - NOT explicitly mentioned\n\nWhile the passage mentions \"chivalry,\" it does not specifically mention \"knights\" as a separate element.\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Indonesia, counting 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a great variety of regional cuisines present throughout the country. However, when this term is used without other qualifiers, it tends to designate foods coming from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java. Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that the Javanese favor being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following ingredients is mainly used in Javanese cuisine?\n\nOptions:\n1. White sugar\n2. Powdered sugar\n3. Coconut sugar\n4. Brown sugar\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage specifically mentions that Javanese cuisine uses \"sucre de coco javanais\" (Javanese coconut sugar) as one of the predominant flavors that the Javanese favor.\n\n3",

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Stellar bodies emit light and heat because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms fuse (or condense) to create heavier elements. Scientists are working on creating a reactor that can produce energy in the same way. This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before we see successful fusion reactors built.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, what does fusion allow stellar bodies to do?\n\nOptions:\n1. To form heavier elements\n2. To build fusion reactors\n3. To emit light and heat\n4. To create hydrogen atoms\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, stellar bodies emit light and heat because of the energy created during fusion. While fusion does create heavier elements (option 1), the question asks what fusion allows stellar bodies to do, and the passage clearly states that they \"emit light and heat because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms fuse.\"\n\n3",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further. Support is not a learning method but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering new instruction such as using a new program or starting a new project. Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but Microsoft Office's little paperclip man is one too. Virtual scaffolding is integrated into software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.\n\n**Question:** According to the information contained in the excerpt, which of the following elements is not an example of support?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The tutorial at the beginning of a video game\n2. A tutor to prepare for the SAT exam\n3. An independent research program\n4. A local sports coach\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nAccording to the passage, support is defined as \"a means of helping learners who are discovering new instruction\" and can be \"virtual and real\" forms that \"question, guide and explain procedures.\" Support helps with things that might be \"too difficult for the student to handle alone.\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n1. A video game tutorial - guides and explains procedures to help players learn\n2. A SAT tutor - helps students with exam preparation they might find difficult alone\n3. An independent research program - emphasizes independence, not guidance or support\n4. A sports coach - guides and helps with skills that might be difficult to learn alone\n\nOption 3 (independent research program) contradicts the concept of support since it emphasizes working independently rather than receiving guidance or help.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: A hospitality exchange network is an organization that connects travelers with residents of the cities they are going to visit. Joining such a network generally only requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional verification. A list of available hosts is then provided either in printed and/or online version, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers. The company Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 by computer programmer Casey Fenton, who had found a cheap flight to Iceland, but no place to stay there. He sent an email to students at the local university and received an impressive number of offers for free accommodation.\n\nQuestion: What is offered to travelers in hospitality exchange networks?\n\nOptions:\n1. Accommodation with locals\n2. Cheap flights\n3. Tours conducted by local guides\n4. Connections with other travelers visiting the same destination\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that hospitality exchange networks connect travelers with residents of cities they plan to visit, and mentions that hosts provide accommodation (as evidenced by Casey Fenton receiving \"offers for free accommodation\"). The networks provide lists of available hosts, which directly corresponds to offering accommodation with locals.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The most widespread type of tourism is perhaps the one that most people associate with travel: Recreational tourism. This is when people go to a place, completely different from what they see daily, to relax and have a good time. Beaches, theme parks, and campgrounds are often the most frequented places by leisure tourists. If the objective of visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture, this type of tourism is then called cultural tourism. Tourists can visit different sites in a given country or choose to focus on a single region.\n\n**Question:** Visiting a museum would be considered as belonging to which category of tourism?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Professional tourism\n2. Recreational tourism\n3. Cultural tourism\n4. Outdoor tourism\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the passage, visiting a museum would be considered cultural tourism because the passage states that \"if the objective of visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture, this type of tourism is then called cultural tourism.\" Museums are specifically designed to showcase history and culture, which aligns with the definition of cultural tourism provided.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Reintegration shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe. Travelers who had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes have great difficulty readapting to their original culture. When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost certain habits of your original culture. At the beginning, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country must adapt. People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.\n\n**Question:** According to the excerpt, for what type of traveler can reintegration shock be particularly difficult?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Travelers who experienced particularly difficult culture shock\n2. Travelers who quickly adapted to life abroad\n3. Travelers still in the honeymoon period\n4. Travelers with little patience\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage states that \"Travelers who had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes have great difficulty readapting to their original culture.\" This directly indicates that those who struggled with cultural adaptation abroad will find reintegration particularly challenging.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire. If you want to learn to throw a boomerang that returns directly to your hand, then make sure you have a boomerang designed to return. In reality, most boomerangs available in Australia do not return. It is better for beginners not to try throwing in the wind.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, which of the following statements correctly describes boomerang throwing?\n\nOptions:\n1. It always returns to the hand if thrown correctly\n2. It is more popular among locals than among tourists\n3. Few boomerangs are available in Australia\n4. Only certain boomerangs can return\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that \"most boomerangs available in Australia do not return\" and emphasizes the need to \"make sure you have a boomerang designed to return.\" This indicates that only specific boomerangs are designed to return, while others are not.\n\n4",

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: The \"push\" symbol looks like a V and the \"pull\" symbol looks like a staple or a square whose bottom side is missing. The up means you should start with the tip and push the bow, and the down means you should start with the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow. An up bow generally produces a softer sound, while a down bow is louder and more assertive. Don't hesitate to write your own marks in pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are there for musical reasons, and should therefore generally be respected.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, which of the following elements is not associated with pulling the bow?\n\nOptions:\n1. A softer sound\n2. A symbol that looks like a staple\n3. A louder sound\n4. Starting with the frog\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nFrom the passage, pulling the bow is associated with:\n- The \"pull\" symbol that looks like a staple (option 2)\n- Starting with the frog (option 4)\n- A down bow movement, which produces a louder, more assertive sound (option 3)\n\nThe softer sound (option 1) is associated with an up bow (pushing), not pulling.\n\n3",

Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous PEC as part of a set of measures aimed at putting the country on the path to new elections. This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October. These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were supposed to take place in 2011.\n\nQuestion: Who suggested the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council?\n\nOptions:\n1.

The members of the Electoral Council suggested it themselves\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, \"a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous PEC.\" The question asks who suggested the resignation (dissolution) of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, and the text clearly states it was the presidential commission.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: The first cases of this seasonal disease were reported at the end of July. Pigs are carriers of the disease, which is then transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The epidemic prompted the Indian government to take measures such as deploying pig collectors in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying pesticides. Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine were also promised by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for next year. Plans to deliver vaccines to historically most affected areas this year have been delayed due to lack of funds and low priority given to these diseases compared to others.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, what will be the last protective measure against the disease to be implemented?\n\nOptions:\n1. Pesticides\n2. Pig collectors\n3. Encephalitis vaccines\n4. Mosquito nets\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage indicates that while pig collectors, mosquito nets, and pesticides have already been deployed as immediate measures, the encephalitis vaccines have been promised for next year and their delivery plans have been delayed due to lack of funds and low priority. This makes vaccines the last measure to be implemented.\n\n3",

In fact, the passage suggests that elite performance is difficult to guarantee.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: With the transition from 400 meters to 800 meters, speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity. Of course, an excellent middle-distance runner, a man capable of breaking a two-minute record must possess good speed, but above all perfectly cultivated endurance. A bit of cross-country in winter, combined with indoor work for the upper body, is the best preparation for the racing season.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, which of the statements below is of paramount importance for an excellent middle-distance runner?\n\nOptions:\n1. Training in cross-country type running in winter\n2. Cultivating endurance rather than speed\n3. Breaking a two-minute record\n4.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from available plant resources. Furthermore, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately, death. The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked. In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large quantity of proteins containing all the vital amino acids. All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" somewhat in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.\n\n**Question:** According to the information contained in the extract, which of the following elements should a primate eat to solve its \"protein problem\"?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Dead leaves\n2. Raw legumes\n3. Crickets\n4. Flower stems\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage explains that plant resources like leaves and legumes are difficult for primates to digest unless cooked, while animal-origin food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest and provides proteins with all vital amino acids. Among the options, crickets are the only animal-origin food that would solve the protein problem as described in the passage.\n\n3",

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: How could Io's gravity affect me? If you stood on Io's surface, you would weigh less than on Earth. A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So gravity, of course, pulls you less.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, which of the statements below about gravity on Io is correct?\n\nOptions:\n1. Earth's gravity would pull you less than Io's gravity\n2. Io's gravity pulls more and that's why you would weigh less\n3. Io's gravity pulls more and that's why you would weigh more\n4. Earth's gravity would pull you more than Io's gravity\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that:\n- You would weigh less on Io than on Earth\n- A 200-pound person on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds on Io\n- Gravity \"pulls you less\" on Io\n\nThis means Io's gravity is weaker than Earth's gravity, so Earth's gravity would pull you more than Io's gravity.\n\n4",

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: A triceratops dentition would have been capable of crushing not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots. Some scientists think that triceratops ate cycads, a type of plant that was very common during the Cretaceous period. These plants resemble a small palm tree with a crown of pointed and bristly leaves. A triceratops could have used its powerful beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk. Other scientists claim that these plants are very toxic, so it is unlikely that a dinosaur would have eaten them, even though today, the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat toxic leaves or fruits.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, which part of a cycad would a triceratops be likely to eat?\n\nOptions:\n1. The bristly leaves\n2. The trunk\n3. The roots\n4. The fruits\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, a triceratops would have used its powerful beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk. This clearly indicates that the triceratops would eat the trunk of the cycad plant, not the leaves (which it would remove first).\n\n2",

In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, particularly the city center. Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma must be researched to understand the state of fighting that persists in the North Kivu province. The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorilla tracking treks among the cheapest in Africa. You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.

Broadly speaking, they can be classified into two categories: either you work during your trip, or you try to limit your expenses. This article focuses mainly on the latter category. For those who are ready to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to reduce expenses to near zero, see minimum budget travel. These tips assume that travelers do not steal, do not break into public places, do not participate in illegal markets, do not beg or exploit other people for their benefit.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, who might have difficulties traveling on a very tight budget?\n\nOptions:\n1. Someone who likes challenges\n2. Someone without time constraints\n3. Someone whose intention is to work remotely during their trip\n4. Someone who appreciates following an itinerary\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe passage states that for minimum budget travel, one must be \"ready to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability.\" This means that someone who appreciates following an itinerary (which requires predictability and planning) would have difficulties with very tight budget travel, as such travel requires sacrificing predictability.\n\nThe other options would not necessarily have difficulties:\n- Someone who likes challenges would likely embrace the challenge of budget travel\n- Someone without time constraints would be fine since budget travel requires sacrificing time\n- Someone planning to work remotely falls into the first category mentioned (working during travel)\n\n4",

Time is also a way to compare the duration (length) of events. You can mark the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that occurs regularly.\n\nQuestion: What would need to be noted about a cyclical event in order to track the passage of time?\n\nOptions:\n1. Its duration\n2. Its repetition\n3. What it affects\n4. Its difficulty\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, \"You can mark the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that occurs regularly.\" The key aspect that allows us to track time through cyclical events is observing their repetition - the fact that they occur regularly and repeatedly.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine claims based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East war. Among the other subjects addressed are the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley. Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a duration of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents to a duration of five years.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, which of the following issues is not included in the document?\n\nOptions:\n1. The future of Jerusalem\n2. The cause of the 1967 war\n3. A military presence in the valley\n4. Border-related conflicts\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLooking at the passage, it mentions:\n- Border disputes (option 4) - explicitly mentioned\n- The future of Jerusalem (option 1) - explicitly mentioned as \"the future State of Jerusalem\"\n- Military presence in the valley (option 3) - explicitly discussed regarding Israel's demands and Palestinian Authority's position\n\nHowever, the passage only references the 1967 war as a temporal marker for the borders (\"borders existing before the 1967 Middle East war\") but does not discuss the causes of that war.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Martelly yesterday installed a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) composed of nine members. This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years. Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous PEC as part of a set of measures aimed at putting the country on the path to new elections. This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October. These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were supposed to take place in 2011.\n\n**Question:** Which statement about the protests is not true?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The presidential commission was a response to the protests\n2. The delay in elections triggered protests\n3. The protests demanded the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council\n4. The protests were sometimes violent\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nLooking at each option against the passage:\n\n1. TRUE - The passage states \"This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests\"\n2. TRUE - The passage states \"protests were triggered by the absence of elections\"\n3. NOT STATED - The passage does not mention that protesters specifically demanded the resignation of the electoral council. It only says the protests were against the regime and triggered by absent elections, and that the commission (as a response) recommended dissolving the PEC.\n4. TRUE - The passage explicitly states \"These sometimes violent protests\"\n\nThe passage does not indicate that the protests specifically called for the resignation of the electoral council. The dissolution was recommended by the presidential commission as a response to the protests, not as a direct demand from the protesters.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Jonny Reid, co-driver of the New Zealand A1GP team, made history today by crossing the Auckland Harbor Bridge (New Zealand), which is 48 years old, legally. Mr. Reid managed, driving the New Zealand A1 GP car called Black Beauty, to exceed a speed of 160 km/h 7 times above the bridge. The New Zealand police had difficulty using their speed radars to see how fast Mr. Reid was driving due to the low level of Black Beauty. The only time the police managed to time Mr. Reid was when he slowed down to 160 km/h.\n\nQuestion: At what moment was the police able to use their radars to time Jonny Reid's speed?\n\nOptions:\n1. When he was driving at 160 km/h\n2. On his seventh pass over the bridge\n3. When he was driving at more than 160 km/h\n4. On his first pass over the bridge\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, the police had difficulty using their speed radars due to the low level of Black Beauty. The text specifically states: \"The only time the police managed to time Mr. Reid was when he slowed down to 160 km/h.\" This indicates that the police could only successfully use their radars when he was driving at exactly 160 km/h, not when he was going faster.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables. A curry dish can be \"solid\" or \"liquid,\" depending on the amount of sauce it contains.

Meat\n2. Vegetables\n3. Yogurt\n4. Spices\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage explains that in northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while in southern India and coastal regions, coconut milk is commonly used instead. This indicates that coconut milk is used as a substitute for yogurt in certain regions.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean. For women: It is recommended that any woman traveling should say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status. It is also advised to wear a wedding ring (which should not appear too valuable). Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider harassment. It is indeed common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc. Be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)\n\nQuestion: According to the description of the region given in the excerpt, what advice would it be wise to give to women who travel?\n\nOptions:\n1. Recognize that it is rare to be followed\n2. Wear a large wedding ring to highlight one's marital status\n3. Understand that cultural differences push one to avoid standing firm\n4. In case of unwanted advances, be firm when rejecting men's advances\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that women should \"be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to stand your ground\" when dealing with unwanted attention. This directly corresponds to option 4. The other options contradict the advice given in the passage: option 1 is wrong because the text says it's common to be followed, option 2 is incorrect because it advises against wearing a ring that appears too valuable, and option 3 contradicts the advice to stand firm despite cultural differences.\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printing shop. During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as \"Dunlap Broadsides.\" The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8. One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10. The 25 Dunlap sheets whose existence is still known are the oldest copies of the document.

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: Avalanches are not abnormal phenomena; steep slopes can only retain a small amount of snow, and the excess spreads in the form of an avalanche. The problem is that snow sticks, so if it collapses, it's because there was a triggering element. Now, a slight collapse of snow can be the trigger for everything else. Sometimes, the triggering element is solar warming on the snow, sometimes it's just more snow, and other times it can be natural events or human activity.\n\nQuestion: Which of the following does not trigger avalanches?\n\nOptions:\n1. Snow that sticks\n2. Humans\n3. Sunlight\n4. More snow\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nAccording to the passage, the triggering elements for avalanches include:\n- Solar warming on snow (sunlight)\n- More snow\n- Human activity\n\nThe passage states that \"snow sticks\" as a characteristic that makes avalanches problematic when they do occur, but it's not mentioned as a trigger. Rather, it's described as a property that makes snow dangerous when it does collapse due to other triggers.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. But the most famous of this entire civilization is probably Homer, the blind poet author of the two greatest masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature. Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, best known for his famous theorem on the relationships of the sides of right triangles.\n\nQuestion: What could the Greek poet Homer not do?\n\nOptions:\n1. Hear\n2. See\n3. Walk\n4. Speak\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that Homer was \"le poète aveugle\" (the blind poet), which means he could not see.\n\n2",

Don't forget to add the additional costs of visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.\n\n**Question:** What should you NOT add when comparing the total price of a ticket to Africa with a round-the-world ticket?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Additional visa fees for places outside Africa\n2. The cost of departure taxes in Africa\n3. The cost of a visa for Africa\n4. The cost of ground transportation in places outside of Africa\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage states that when comparing prices, you should add \"additional costs of visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.\" This means you should add costs for places outside Africa, but NOT add costs that are already included in the Africa trip itself (like departure taxes in Africa or visas for Africa).\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: \"We will strive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP significantly by 2020 compared to the 2005 level,\" declared Mr. Hu. He did not quantify these reductions, saying that they will be based on Chinese economic output. Hu encouraged developing countries \"to avoid the old method that consisted of polluting first and cleaning up afterwards.\" He added that \"however, they should not be asked to assume obligations that exceed their stage of development, their responsibility and their capabilities.\"\n\nQuestion: What did Mr. Hu not mention?\n\nOptions:\n1. What the reductions are based on\n2. Advice to developing countries regarding pollution\n3. A date by which he hopes carbon emissions will be reduced\n4.

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works. The bulb must then be replaced. You must be careful when changing the bulb. First, the switch of the lighting fixture must be turned off or the cable unplugged. This is due to the fact that the electric current flowing in the socket, where the metal part of the bulb fits, can cause serious electric shocks if you come into contact with its interior or its metal base while the bulb is still partially inserted in the socket.\n\nQuestion: According to the excerpt, what eventually prevents a light bulb from working?\n\nOptions:\n1. The fact that the lighting fixture is not turned off properly\n2. The fact that the metal base of the bulb is only partially inserted in the socket\n3. The fact that the filament in the bulb has burned out\n4. The slowing down of electric current in the socket\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states in the first sentence that \"after hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works.\" This directly answers what prevents a light bulb from functioning.\n\n3",

Similarly, men must wear pants covering their knees. You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.

A stole\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, monasteries provide stoles for women, and pants can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance.

Around 10:00 am\n2. After tightening their defense\n3. After losing to Zambia\n4. As the tournament progressed\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage states that South Africa \"seemed decidedly rusty during their match against their southern counterparts, however gradually improved throughout the tournament\" (s'est cependant graduellement améliorée au fil du tournoi).

The passage says he was born in Zagreb but doesn't mention playing for a Zagreb team before Partizan - This is NOT stated\n3. The passage says he stayed at Partizan \"jusqu'en 1958\" (until 1958), not 1995 - This is FALSE\n4.

Even standing among the ruins of thousand-year antiquity, it's easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-past battles, almost hear the clatter of hooves on cobblestones and sense the fear emanating from pits in the dungeons. But is our fantasy based on reality? Why were these castles built at all? How were they designed and constructed?\n\n**Question:** What is not mentioned in the given text as something that can be associated with medieval castles?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Dungeons\n2. Duels\n3. Nobility\n4.

This was preceded by a 25-minute meeting with NDP leader Jack Layton at the House of Commons on Tuesday. At the meeting with the Prime Minister, Layton requested changes and to 'completely rewrite' the Conservative Party's environmental bill. Since the federal government intervened and took over funding of Mercy Hospital in Devonport (Tasmania), the state government and some federal parliament members have criticized this action as a ploy ahead of federal elections scheduled for November. But Prime Minister John Howard stated that this was done only to protect the hospital from reduced funding by the Tasmanian government through the allocation of an additional 45 million Australian dollars.\"\n\nQuestion: Who refuted the claim that the \"Clean Air Act\" was used as an election ploy?\n\nOptions:\n1. State government member\n2. Prime Minister\n3. NDP leader\n4. Federal parliament member\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLooking at the passage, there appears to be some confusion in the question. The passage discusses two separate issues: the Clean Air Act (involving Stephen Harper and Jack Layton) and the Mercy Hospital funding (involving John Howard). \n\nThe question asks about who refuted claims that the \"Clean Air Act\" was used as an election ploy, but the passage only mentions election ploy accusations regarding the hospital funding, not the Clean Air Act. Prime Minister John Howard refuted the claims about the hospital funding being an election ploy.\n\nGiven the context and the fact that it was a Prime Minister who made the refutation statement in the passage, the answer is:\n\n2",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** After a leak of several thousand barrels of crude oil south of Fairbanks (Alaska), authorities shut down an 800-mile section of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. A power outage after routine testing of the fire system led to the opening of safety valves and overflow of crude oil near pumping station #9 in Fort Greely. The opening of the valves caused a pressure drop in the system, and oil spilled onto the site into a reservoir that can hold 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons). By Wednesday noon, there was still a leak in the reservoir vents, possibly due to thermal expansion in the reservoir. Another auxiliary containment area under the reservoirs with a capacity of 104,500 barrels had not yet been fully utilized.\n\n**Question:** Why did the safety valves open?\n\n**Options:**\n1.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Virtual teams are required to achieve the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences. Virtual team members often function as liaisons for their direct physical groups. Virtual teams sometimes hold meetings according to time zones, but since such practices are difficult for local management to understand, members often have higher autonomy than traditional team members. The existence of a true \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of virtual teams. The \"invisible team\" refers to the management who are the superiors of each member. The invisible team sets standards for each member.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, in what way are traditional teams and virtual teams similar?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Both teams are required to achieve the same level of performance\n2. Both teams have various levels of autonomy in their daily routines\n3. Both teams are under the supervision of invisible management\n4. Both teams function in the same time zone\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage states that \"Virtual teams are required to achieve the same level of excellence as traditional teams\" (バーチャルチームは、従来のチームと同じ水準の卓越性が求められます).

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further. Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather something to support people who are using new computer programs, starting new projects, or having new learning experiences. Scaffolding exists in both virtual and real forms. In other words, teachers are a form of scaffolding, and so is the Microsoft Office clip character. Virtual scaffolds are built into this software and are intended to enable questions, instructions, and explanations about procedures that students would find difficult to do alone.\n\n**Question:** Based on the information in the passage, which of these is NOT an example of scaffolding?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Tutorial at the start of a computer game\n2. SAT instructor\n3. Self-study program\n4.

To participate in such networks, you usually just need to fill out an online application form, but some networks require additional authentication or verification. A list of available accommodations is provided in print or online, and sometimes includes ratings and opinions from other travelers. Couchsurfing is a community launched in January 2004 by computer programmer Casey Fenton, based on his experience of finding a cheap flight to Iceland but being unable to find accommodation. When he inquired via email to local university students, he received an overwhelming number of offers for free accommodation.\n\n**Question:** What do hospitality exchange networks provide to tourists?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Accommodation provided by local hosts\n2. Cheap airline tickets\n3. Tours by local guides\n4. Connections with travelers visiting the same destination\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage clearly states that hospitality exchange networks connect local people with travelers and provide lists of available accommodations.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Perhaps the most common form of tourism business is recreational tourism, which most people associate with travel. This is when people go to places completely different from their daily lives and enjoy themselves in a relaxed mood. Beaches, theme parks, and campgrounds are the most common places that recreational tourism visitors frequently visit. When the purpose of visiting a specific place is to learn about the history and culture of that place, that type of tourism is called cultural tourism. Tourists have the option of either visiting various landmarks in a country or focusing on only one region.\n\n**Question:** What category of tourism business would visiting a museum be classified under?\n\n**Options:**\n1.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Re-entry shock arrives earlier than culture shock (when the honeymoon period is short), lasts longer, and symptoms can worsen. Even travelers who easily adapted to a new culture may struggle to readjust to their home country's unique culture. When returning home after living abroad, one loses familiarity with their home culture's customs to the extent that they adapted to the new culture. If it's someone's first overseas trip, the people around them will probably respond with patience and understanding, because they know that travelers need time to adjust. People may not expect that travelers also require patience and understanding when returning home.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, what type of traveler finds it particularly difficult to endure re-entry shock?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Travelers who experienced particularly bad culture shock\n2. Travelers who quickly adapted during their overseas life\n3. Travelers who are still in their honeymoon period\n4. Travelers with weak patience\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage states that \"even travelers who easily adapted to a new culture may struggle to readjust to their home country's unique culture\" and \"when returning home after living abroad, one loses familiarity with their home culture's customs to the extent that they adapted to the new culture.\" This indicates that those who adapted well abroad have more difficulty with re-entry shock because they've lost touch with their home culture.\n\n2",

If thrown correctly, it always returns to your hand\n2. It is more popular among local residents than tourists\n3. There are very few boomerangs available in Australia\n4. Only some boomerangs are able to return\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage clearly states that \"Most boomerangs available in Australia actually do not return\" and mentions the need to \"prepare a boomerang that is suitable for returning.\" This indicates that only certain types of boomerangs can return, not all of them.\n\nOption 1 is incorrect because the passage says most boomerangs don't return.\nOption 2 is incorrect because the passage mentions it's popular among tourists.\nOption 3 is incorrect because the passage says boomerangs are available in Australia, just that most don't return.\nOption 4 correctly reflects that only some boomerangs (those \"suitable for returning\") can actually return.\n\n4",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The up-bow mark looks like a V-shape, and the down-bow mark looks like a stapler staple or a rectangle with the bottom missing. Up means starting from the tip and pushing the bow, while down means starting from the frog (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pulling the bow. Up-bow usually produces a soft sound, while down-bow produces a stronger, more assertive sound. You can freely write in markings with a pencil, but remember that printed bow markings have musical reasons. Usually, you should follow those markings.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, which of the following is NOT related to pulling the bow?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Soft sound\n2. Stapler staple-like mark\n3. Stronger sound\n4. Starting from the frog\n\n**Analysis:**\nAccording to the passage:\n- Pulling the bow = down-bow (下げ弓)\n- Down-bow is associated with: stapler staple-like mark, stronger/assertive sound, and starting from the frog\n- Up-bow (pushing the bow) is associated with: V-shaped mark and soft sound\n\nTherefore, \"soft sound\" is NOT related to pulling the bow - it's related to pushing the bow (up-bow).\n\n1",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The first case of this season was reported in late July. This disease is carried by pigs and then transmitted to humans through mosquitoes as vectors. Due to this outbreak, the Indian government took measures such as deploying pig catchers to severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying insecticides. Millions of encephalitis vaccines have also been promised by the government, which will help health organizations prepare for next year. This year, there was a plan to deliver vaccines to historically most severely affected areas, but it was delayed due to insufficient funding and lower priority compared to other diseases.\n\n**Question:** Based on the content of the passage, which measure will be implemented last for disease prevention?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Insecticides\n2. Pig catchers\n3. Encephalitis vaccine\n4. Mosquito nets\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage describes measures already taken (pig catchers, mosquito nets, insecticide spraying) and mentions that vaccines were promised for next year's preparation, with this year's vaccine delivery being delayed due to funding issues and lower priority. This indicates that the encephalitis vaccine will be implemented last among the prevention measures.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Nutritional therapy alone will not produce world-class athletes, but nutritional intake can greatly influence the overall health condition of young athletes. Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding various practical aspects of supplements are beneficial for both improving athletes' performance and promoting sports.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, which of the following is NOT recommended as a way for young athletes to enjoy sports more?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Practicing proper nutritional intake\n2. Maintaining elite-level performance\n3. Effective hydration\n4. Maintaining a healthy energy balance\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage discusses nutritional therapy and its benefits for young athletes, mentioning three specific recommendations:\n- Maintaining healthy energy balance\n- Practicing effective hydration habits  \n- Understanding supplements\n\nThe passage explicitly states that \"nutritional therapy alone will not produce world-class athletes,\" which suggests that maintaining elite-level performance is not what's being recommended. Instead, the focus is on health and general performance improvement through proper nutrition.\n\nOptions 1, 3, and 4 are all directly mentioned in the passage as beneficial practices. Option 2 (maintaining elite-level performance) is not recommended in the passage and contradicts the opening statement.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** When transitioning from a quarter marathon to a half marathon, the importance of speed becomes much lower, and endurance becomes absolutely necessary. Of course, elite half marathon runners who break 2 minutes should have considerable speed, but no matter what, they must continue to build endurance. Cross-country running in winter while going to the gym to train the upper body would be the best preparation for the running season.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, which of the following is most important for elite half-mile marathon runners?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Doing cross-country running in winter\n2. Building endurance rather than speed\n3. Achieving times under 2 minutes\n4. Increasing speed rather than endurance\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage clearly states that when moving from quarter marathon to half marathon, \"the importance of speed becomes much lower, and endurance becomes absolutely necessary.\" It emphasizes that even elite runners \"must continue to build endurance\" regardless of circumstances. This directly supports option 2.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** For primates with digestive systems like humans, it is difficult to obtain essential amino acids from plant resources available in savanna environments. Moreover, if this is neglected, it leads to serious situations such as growth inhibition and malnutrition, ultimately resulting in death. The most easily obtainable plant resources were proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are nutrients that are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking. On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and are high-quality protein sources containing all essential amino acids. Considering all points, it would not be surprising if our ancestors solved the \"protein problem\" in the same way as chimpanzees living in today's savannas.\n\n**Question:** Based on the information in the passage, what should primates eat to solve the \"protein problem\"?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Dead leaves\n2. Raw legumes\n3. Grasshoppers\n4. Flower stems\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage explains that plant resources like leaves and legumes are difficult for primates to digest without cooking, while animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and contain all essential amino acids. Among the options, grasshoppers (option 3) are the only animal food source mentioned, which aligns with the passage's explanation that animal foods solve the protein problem for primates.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, it automatically becomes a call routed through satellites. Artificial satellites in space receive the call and reflect it almost instantaneously. Satellites were sent to space by rockets. The reason scientists use telescopes in space is because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and scenery that enters human vision. To launch and deploy satellites and telescopes in space, first a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is required.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following reflects long-distance phone calls to Earth?\n\n**Options:**\n1.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** How does gravity work on Io? If you were to stand on Io's surface, your weight would be less than when you are on Earth. A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. Naturally, gravity becomes lighter.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, which of the following is an accurate description of Io's gravity?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Earth's gravity is less than Io's gravity\n2. Io's gravity is stronger, so body weight becomes lighter\n3. Io's gravity is stronger, so body weight becomes heavier\n4. Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's gravity\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage clearly states that:\n- Your weight would be less on Io than on Earth\n- A 200-pound person on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds on Io\n- Gravity becomes lighter on Io\n\nThis means Earth's gravity is stronger than Io's gravity, which is why you weigh less on Io.\n\n4",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Kirby Muxloe Castle, a typical castle of this era, gives off an atmosphere more like a fortified mansion than a castle. With its large glass windows and thin walls, it would not have been able to withstand a prolonged and determined attack. In the 1480s when construction was begun by Lord Hastings, this country was relatively peaceful, and defense was only needed to protect against small groups of wandering raiders.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following is an accurate description of Kirby Muxloe Castle?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The castle's thick walls were at Lord Hastings' request\n2. Because the era in which it was built had characteristics of a peace-loving country, only minimal fortification was necessary\n3. This castle's structure was not common for that era\n4. It was built to withstand prolonged intense attacks\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the passage, Kirby Muxloe Castle was built during a relatively peaceful time in the 1480s when only minimal defense against small groups of raiders was needed. The passage explicitly states the country was \"relatively peaceful\" and that defense was only needed against \"small groups of wandering raiders,\" which aligns with option 2. The passage contradicts options 1 (mentions thin walls, not thick), 3 (describes it as \"typical\" of the era), and 4 (states it could not withstand prolonged attacks).\n\n2",

Some scientists believe that Triceratops ate cycad plants that grew abundantly during the Cretaceous period. These plants have sharp, pointed crown-like leaves and are low shrubs that resemble palms in appearance. Triceratops may have stripped off the leaves with their strong beaks before eating the tree trunks. Other scientists argue that because these plants are extremely toxic, it is unlikely that any dinosaurs ate them, even though today sloths and other animals (descendants of dinosaurs) like parrots can eat poisonous leaves and fruits.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, which part of the cycad was Triceratops most likely to have eaten?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Sharp pointed leaves\n2. Trunk\n3. Roots\n4. Fruit\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage states that \"Triceratops may have stripped off the leaves with their strong beaks before eating the tree trunks.\" This indicates that after removing the leaves, Triceratops would eat the trunks/stems of the cycad plants.\n\n2",

In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the streets, especially the city center, were buried. Goma is quite safe, but if you visit places other than Goma, you need to investigate and understand the situation of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province. This city is a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and is also one of the places where you can track mountain gorillas most cheaply in Africa. For transportation in Goma, you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis). The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for short distances.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following is NOT good advice for tourists in Goma?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The fighting in North Kivu is interesting\n2. It is a good place for low-cost mountain gorilla tracking\n3. Motorcycle taxis are a good means of getting around\n4. The base for Mount Nyiragongo is in the city\n\n**Analysis:**\nLooking at each option:\n1. The passage warns that tourists need to investigate and understand the fighting situation in North Kivu for safety reasons - it does not suggest the fighting is \"interesting\" or something to seek out\n2. The passage states Goma is \"one of the places where you can track mountain gorillas most cheaply in Africa\" - this is good advice\n3. The passage mentions boda-boda can be used for transportation in Goma - this is practical advice\n4.

In particular, the number systems of French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland show some peculiarities that differ from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is also subtly different. However, since all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss should have learned standard French in school, they should understand even if the standard French number system is used.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following is different in France compared to Belgium and Switzerland?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Pronunciation of all words\n2. Number system\n3. Standard French taught in school\n4.

Snow with adhesive properties - This is described as why a trigger is needed, not as a trigger itself\n2. Humans - This matches \"human factors\" mentioned in the passage\n3. Sunlight - This matches \"solar heat\" that causes snow melting mentioned in the passage\n4. Additional snowfall - This matches \"increased snowfall\" mentioned in the passage\n\nOptions 2, 3, and 4 are all mentioned as triggers. Since the question asks which \"can be\" a trigger (singular form but accepting any valid answer), all three are correct according to the passage. However, looking at the most directly stated triggers in order of mention: solar heat (sunlight), increased snowfall, and human factors.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** There are many famous Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. Perhaps the most famous bearer of this ancient culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who composed the two great masterpieces of Greek literature, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Sophocles and Aristophanes are playwrights who are still popular today, and their plays are praised as masterpieces of world literature. Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is mainly known for discovering the famous theorem about the relationship between the sides of right triangles.\n\n**Question:** What was the Greek poet Homer unable to do?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Hear\n2. See\n3. Walk\n4. Speak\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage clearly states that Homer was a \"legendary blind poet\" (伝説の盲目詩人). Being blind means he was unable to see.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, and Turkish Airlines are significantly expanding their routes to Africa, operating connecting flights to major African cities at more affordable rates than other European airlines. As of 2014, Turkish Airlines serves 39 cities in 30 African countries. When travel times become longer, check how the total fare estimate to Africa compares with round-the-world fares. When visiting places other than Africa, don't forget additional costs such as additional visa applications, departure taxes, and ground transportation fees.\n\n**Question:** When comparing the total fare estimate for flights to Africa with round-the-world fares, what is something that does not need to be added?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Additional visa costs for places other than Africa\n2. Departure tax costs for Africa\n3. Visa costs for Africa\n4. Ground transportation costs for places other than Africa\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage mentions that when visiting places OTHER than Africa, you need to consider additional costs like visa applications, departure taxes, and ground transportation fees. This implies these additional costs are for non-African destinations. The question asks what doesn't need to be added when comparing Africa trip costs to round-the-world fares.\n\nSince the comparison is specifically about going to Africa, the visa costs for Africa itself would already be included in the basic Africa trip cost and wouldn't be an \"additional\" cost to consider in the comparison.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** \"We will strive to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions per GDP from 2005 levels by 2020,\" stated President Hu Jintao. Although Hu did not specify the numerical reduction target, he said that the reduction would be implemented based on China's economic output. President Hu Jintao called on developing countries to \"avoid the previous approach of polluting first and cleaning up later.\" He added, \"However, they should not be required to take on obligations that exceed their development stage, responsibilities, and capabilities.\"\n\n**Question:** Which of the following did Hu Jintao NOT mention?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Standards for reduction\n2. Advice to developing countries regarding pollution\n3. The deadline by which carbon dioxide emission reductions are expected\n4. Numerical values for carbon dioxide emission reduction\n\n**Analysis:**\nLooking at what Hu Jintao mentioned in the passage:\n- He mentioned the deadline (by 2020) - so option 3 is mentioned\n- He mentioned advice to developing countries about avoiding the \"pollute first, clean up later\" approach - so option 2 is mentioned  \n- He mentioned the standard/basis for reduction (GDP-based reduction from 2005 levels) - so option 1 is mentioned\n- The passage explicitly states \"Hu did not specify the numerical reduction target\" - so option 4 was NOT mentioned\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The Babylonians built primary temples for each of their gods, which were considered the homes of the gods. People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to fulfill the gods' wishes through rituals and festivals. Each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter. As part of the temple, a special pyramid-shaped tower called a ziggurat was sometimes built. The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, where would ordinary Babylonian citizens not be seen?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Places where sacrifices are offered in the temple courtyard\n2. Places where rituals are performed in the primary temple\n3. Places of festivals in the temple courtyard\n4. Places where sacrifices are offered in the inner sanctuary\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage clearly states that \"each temple had an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.\" This means ordinary citizens would not be found in the inner sanctuary, as it was restricted to priests only. While people could offer sacrifices and participate in festivals in the open courtyard areas, they were prohibited from entering the inner sanctuary.\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** After several hundred hours of continuous use, the filament inside the light bulb eventually burns out and the bulb stops lighting up. This is when bulb replacement becomes necessary. Caution is required when replacing a light bulb. First, you need to turn off the lighting fixture's switch or disconnect the cable. This is because when part of the bulb is inside the socket, touching the socket or the metal parts of the bulb can cause severe electric shock due to the current flowing through the socket that the bulb's metal parts are in contact with.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, what is the cause of a light bulb stopping to light up?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The lighting fixture's switch not being turned off properly\n2. The bulb's metal base being only partially inside the socket\n3. The filament inside the bulb burning out\n4. The speed of current flowing to the socket slowing down\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that \"after several hundred hours of continuous use, the filament inside the light bulb eventually burns out and the bulb stops lighting up.\" This directly identifies the cause as the filament burning out.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered as well. Most monasteries prepare coverings for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you'll receive smiles from the monks and nuns at the entrance. Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees. These can also be borrowed at the reception desk at the entrance, but considering that they are not washed after each user, some people might be reluctant to wear them. They are one-size-fits-all for men.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following clothing items is unlikely to be borrowed at a monastery?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Skirt\n2. Shorts\n3. Pants\n4. Cloth/fabric\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage mentions that monasteries provide coverings for women (which would include skirts) and pants for men that can be borrowed at the reception desk. It also mentions that monasteries prepare \"coverings\" (cloth/fabric) for visitors. However, shorts are not mentioned as something that can be borrowed, and in fact, the passage indicates that both men and women need to cover their knees, which suggests shorts would not be appropriate attire that monasteries would provide.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The match kicked off at 10:00 AM, and the light rain that had fallen in the morning cleared up completely, making it a perfect day for 7-a-side rugby. South Africa, the top seed in this tournament, showed a good start by achieving a convincing 26-0 victory over 5th-seeded Zambia. Although they appeared clearly rusty in their match against their southern sister nation, South Africa steadily improved their form as the tournament progressed. Their disciplined defense, ball-handling skills, and excellent teamwork were outstanding, and it was clear that this team was the winner.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, when did South Africa's performance start to improve?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Around 10:00 AM\n2. After tightening their defense\n3. After losing to Zambia\n4. As the tournament progressed\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage states \"南アフリカは大会が進むにつれて着実に調子を上げていきました\" which translates to \"South Africa steadily improved their form as the tournament progressed.\" This directly corresponds to option 4.\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Research in the 20th century has shown that genetic variation has two gene pools: hidden ones and expressed ones. New genetic variations are added through mutations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations. Habitat segregation and recombination shuffle variations while moving back and forth between the two pools from generation to generation.\n\n**Question:** Which process is a factor in adding genetic mutations?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Segregation\n2. Recombination\n3. Mutation\n4. Expression\n\n**Answer:**\nAccording to the passage, \"New genetic variations are added through mutations\" (突然変異で新しい遺伝的変異が加わり). This clearly states that mutations are the process that adds new genetic variations.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Bobek, who was born in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, became famous during his time playing for Partizan Belgrade. He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958. During his time there, he appeared in 468 matches and scored 403 goals. No other player has achieved as many appearances or goals for this club as Bobek did. In 1995, he was selected as the greatest player in Partizan's history.\n\n**Question:** Which statement is correct about Bobek's career at Partizan Belgrade?\n\n**Options:**\n1. He debuted at Partizan in 1945\n2. He played for Zagreb before Partizan Belgrade\n3. He played for Partizan until 1995\n4. He became famous after being selected as Partizan's greatest player\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Option 1: The passage states he \"joined them in 1945\" which supports this.\n- Option 2: The passage says he was born in Zagreb but doesn't mention playing for a team there before Partizan.\n- Option 3: The passage says he stayed until 1958, not 1995. In 1995 he was selected as the greatest player.\n- Option 4: The passage indicates he became famous during his playing time at Partizan, and was selected as greatest player in 1995 (long after his playing career ended in 1958).\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Children develop awareness of race and racial stereotypes from a very early age, and these racial stereotypes influence their behavior. For example, children who identify themselves with minority races that are trapped in preconceived notions tend to perform poorly in school when they become aware of stereotypes related to their own race, especially if they are not doing well in school.\n\n**Question:** According to the content in the passage, what might children's racial stereotypes potentially influence?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The minority race they decide they belong to\n2. Their own behavior\n3. Relationships with other children\n4. The definition of race\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that \"these racial stereotypes influence their behavior\" (こうした人種の固定観念が行動に影響を与えます). The passage then provides an example of how awareness of racial stereotypes affects children's academic performance, which is a form of behavior. The passage does not mention influences on choice of racial identity, relationships with other children, or definitions of race.\n\n2",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Regular teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams but there are subtle differences. Virtual team members often use email as a communication place for their physical group at that time. Often they have more freedom than regular team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones and may not be understood by their management. The presence of a true \"invisible team\" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique feature of virtual teams. An \"invisible team\" is a management team where each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, how are regular teams and virtual teams similar?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Both are expected to have the same level of performance\n2. Both teams have different levels of freedom in daily activities\n3. Both teams work under invisible supervisors\n4. Both work in the same time zone\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage states that \"Regular teams are held to the same standards of excellence as regular teams\" (though this seems to be a translation issue, it likely means virtual teams are held to the same standards as regular teams). This indicates that both types of teams are expected to maintain the same level of performance or excellence.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The original castle of medieval times sparked imagination, and brought images of military competitions, feasts and chivalry. Even standing in the middle of ruins thousands of years old, it is easy to have a picture of the sounds and smells of battles fought long ago, and almost hear the neighing of horses on stone roads and smell fear from the underground dungeons. But are our thoughts based on truth? Why were fortresses built there in the beginning? How were they designed and constructed?\n\n**Question:** Which answer is NOT mentioned in the passage as something that can be associated with medieval castles?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Underground dungeons\n2. Military competitions  \n3. Chivalry\n4. Heroes\n\n**Analysis:**\nLooking at the passage, I can identify what IS mentioned:\n- Underground dungeons (jela za chini kwa chini) - mentioned\n- Military competitions (mashindano ya kivita) - mentioned  \n- Chivalry (uungwana) - mentioned\n- Heroes (mashujaa) - NOT mentioned in the passage\n\nThe passage talks about military competitions, feasts, chivalry, sounds and smells of battles, horses neighing, and underground dungeons, but does not mention heroes.\n\n4",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective term that encompasses a wide variety of foods found throughout the country. However, when used without further qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java. The food commonly found in the wide areas of the archipelago consists of Javanese dishes prepared with coastal expertise, with its basic flavor being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following is commonly used in Javanese cuisine?\n\n**Options:**\n1. White sugar\n2. Powdered sugar\n3. Coconut sugar\n4. Brown sugar\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage specifically mentions that the basic flavor of Javanese cuisine includes \"sukari ya nazi ya Javanese\" (Javanese coconut sugar), indicating that coconut sugar is commonly used in Javanese dishes.\n\n3",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Stars produce light and heat because of the energy generated when hydrogen atoms are combined (or fused) together to form heavier elements. Scientists are working to create nuclear reactors that can generate energy in the same way. This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before suitable nuclear reactors are built.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, atomic fusion allows stars to do what?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Form heavier elements\n2. Build nuclear reactors\n3. Produce light and heat\n4. Generate hydrogen atoms\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage states that stars produce light and heat because of the energy generated when hydrogen atoms are fused together. While fusion does create heavier elements (option 1), the question asks what fusion \"allows stars to do\" - and according to the passage, the direct result that stars achieve through fusion is producing light and heat.\n\n3",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** While basic education of a project should make learning easier and more enjoyable, scaffolding goes a step further. Training methods are not a way of reading but services that provide assistance to people who are going through new learning situations such as using a new computer program or starting a new project. Platforms can be obvious and also real, in other words, a teacher is a type of platform but so is that paper clip character in Microsoft Office. Email platforms have been embedded within programs for the purpose of questioning, persuading, and explaining procedures that might have been too challenging for a student to handle alone.\n\n**Question:** According to the explanation in this passage, which of these is NOT an example of scaffolding/supportive instruction?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Instructions at the beginning of a computer game\n2. SAT teacher\n3. Independent training program\n4. Little league coach\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage describes scaffolding as assistance provided to people going through new learning situations, with examples including teachers and helpful program features like the Microsoft Office paper clip. An \"independent training program\" would be the opposite of scaffolding since it lacks the supportive guidance element that defines scaffolding.\n\n3",

Joining such a network usually only requires filling out an online form; however, some networks will provide or require additional verification.

Staying in people's homes for a period was established in January 2004 after computer programmer Casey Fenton got a cheap flight to Iceland but had nowhere to stay. He sent emails to university students there and received many offers of free accommodation.\n\n**Question:** What is given to travelers through hospitality exchange networks?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Accommodation and hosts\n2. Cheap flights\n3. Tours provided by local guides\n4. Connections with other travelers visiting the area\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the passage, hospitality exchange networks connect travelers with hosts and provide accommodation. The passage specifically mentions that these networks connect travelers with hosts in cities they visit, and the example given shows Casey Fenton receiving offers of free accommodation through such a network.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Perhaps the most common type of tourism that most people associate with travel is: Recreational tourism. This is when people go to places that are very different from their ordinary daily lives to rest and enjoy themselves. Beaches, special parks, and camping areas are often places that are visited most by recreational tourists. If a traveler's goal of visiting a specific place is to learn about its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism. Tourists can visit different landmarks of specific countries or they can simply choose to focus on just one area.\n\n**Question:** What type of tourism is visiting museums?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Business tourism\n2. Recreational tourism\n3. Cultural tourism\n4. Outdoor activity tourism\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the passage, visiting museums would fall under cultural tourism, as the passage states that when the goal of visiting a specific place is to learn about its history and culture, this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism. Museums are places where people go to learn about history and culture.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Reverse culture shock comes faster than culture shock (there is a period below the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe. Travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a hard time readjusting to their original culture. When returning home after living abroad, you have become accustomed to the new culture and lost some of your behaviors from your home culture. When you first went abroad, people were perhaps patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a foreign country need to adapt. People may not expect that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, reverse culture shock can be especially difficult for what type of traveler?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Travelers who experienced particularly bad culture shock\n2. Travelers who adapted quickly when they were living abroad\n3. Travelers who are still in the honeymoon period\n4. Travelers with little patience\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage specifically states that \"Travelers who had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes have a hard time readjusting to their original culture.\" This directly corresponds to option 2 - travelers who adapted quickly when living abroad.\n\n2",

      "**Translation:**\n\nPassage: \"The 'up bow' sign looks like a V and the 'down bow sign' looks like a bracket or a square missing its bottom side. Up means you should start from inside and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow. The up bow typically produces a gentle sound, while the down bow is stronger and more solid. Feel free to write your marks in pencil, but remember the printed bowing marks are there for musical reasons, so they should be respected.\"\n\nQuestion: According to this passage, which of the following is NOT related to pulling the bow?\n\nOptions:\n1. Gentle sound\n2. A sign that looks like a bracket\n3. A stronger sound\n4. Starting at the frog\n\n**Analysis:**\nAccording to the passage:\n- \"Down bow\" involves pulling the bow and is associated with: starting at the frog, stronger/more solid sound, and a sign that looks like a bracket\n- \"Up bow\" involves pushing the bow (not pulling) and produces a gentle sound\n\nTherefore, \"gentle sound\" is NOT related to pulling the bow - it's related to pushing the bow (up bow).\n\n1",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The first cases of this disease this season were reported at the end of July. This disease is carried by pigs, then transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. This outbreak has prompted the Indian government to take measures such as sending pig hunters to the most affected areas, and distributing thousands of mosquito nets and spraying insecticides. Several million doses of brain inflammation vaccine have been promised by the government, which will help prepare health agents for next year. Plans to deliver vaccines this year to areas historically known to be most affected were delayed due to lack of funds and low priority compared to other diseases.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, which preventive measure against the disease will be implemented last?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Insecticides\n2. Pig hunters\n3. Brain inflammation vaccine\n4. Mosquito nets\n\n**Answer:**\nLooking at the timeline in the passage, the immediate measures being taken now include sending pig hunters, distributing mosquito nets, and spraying insecticides. However, the brain inflammation vaccine is described as being promised for \"next year\" and the delivery plans were delayed.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** For the transition from quarter-mile to half-mile races, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes the most crucial requirement. Indeed, a first-class half-mile runner, someone who can qualify in two minutes, must have sufficient speed, but endurance must be maintained throughout the entire dangerous period. Moderate cross-country running during the cold season, along with activities in the exercise hall for the upper body, is the best preparation for the racing season.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, which of the following is most important for a first-class half-mile runner?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Doing moderate cross-country running exercises during the cold season months\n2. Developing endurance more than speed\n3. Qualifying in two minutes\n4.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Outside in the savanna, it is difficult for large animals that have a digestive system like humans to satisfy their amino acid requirements from plant materials that are available. However, failing to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death. Easily accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and beans, but these are difficult for high-level mammals like us to digest unless they are cooked. In comparison, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily chewed, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain essential amino acids. All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" in the same way that savanna primates do today.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, which of these should large animals eat to solve the \"protein problem\"?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Dried leaves\n2. Uncooked beans\n3. Insects\n4. Flower nectar\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage clearly states that animal foods like ants, termites, and eggs are easily digestible and provide high-quality proteins with essential amino acids, unlike plant materials which are difficult to digest unless cooked. Insects (panzi) fall into this category of easily digestible animal protein sources.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use satellites. The satellite that is in the sky receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost immediately. The satellite was sent to the sky using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in the sky because Earth's atmosphere disturbs part of the light and our view. You need a large rocket with a length of more than 100 feet to put a satellite or telescope in the sky.\n\n**Question:** Which of the following is correct about long-distance calls returning to Earth?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Telescope\n2. Satellite\n3. Light\n4. Rocket\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage clearly states that when making long-distance calls, satellites receive the call and reflect it back down to Earth.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** How would Io's gravity pull you? If you were to stand on Io's surface, you would weigh less than you do on Earth. A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kilograms) on Earth would weigh 36 pounds (16 kilograms) on Io. Therefore, gravity, without doubt, pulls very little on you.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, which of the following statements is correct about gravity on the planet Io?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Earth's gravity would pull you less than Io's gravity\n2. Io's gravity pulls more, that's why your weight would decrease\n3. Io's gravity pulls more, that's why your weight would increase\n4. Earth's gravity would pull you more than Io's gravity\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage clearly states that a person would weigh much less on Io than on Earth (200 pounds on Earth vs 36 pounds on Io), and that Io's gravity \"pulls very little.\" This means Io's gravity is weaker than Earth's gravity, so Earth's gravity pulls more than Io's gravity.\n\n4",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Triceratops teeth could crush not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots. Some scientists think that Triceratops ate cycads, which are a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous period. This plant looks like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp-pointed leaves with thorns. Triceratops would use its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the stem. Other scientists claim that this plant has strong poison and therefore it's unlikely that any dinosaur ate it, although today sloths and other animals like parrots (descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, which part of the cycad plant could Triceratops eat?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Thorny leaves\n2. Stem\n3. Root\n4. Fruits\n\n**Answer:**\nAccording to the passage, Triceratops would use its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the stem (\"Triceratops angeutumia mdomo wake wenye nguvu kuyatoa majani kabla ya kula shina\").\n\n2",

This can also be borrowed from the stock at the gate, but these clothes are not washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all for men!\n\n**Question:** Which of the following clothes cannot be borrowed from the monastery?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Skirts\n2. Short pants\n3. Long pants\n4. Kanga\n\n**Analysis:**\nFrom the passage, it's clear that monasteries provide:\n- Kangas for women (mentioned explicitly)\n- Pants/trousers for men that cover the knees (mentioned explicitly)\n- The passage mentions that skirts are not washed after each user, implying they are also available for borrowing\n\nHowever, short pants (suruali fupi) are not mentioned as being provided by monasteries. In fact, the passage states that men need to wear pants that cover the knees, which would exclude short pants.\n\n2",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** While being born in the capital city of Croatia, Zagreb, Bobek gained fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade. He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958. During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 matches. No one else has ever appeared more or scored more goals for the club than Bobek. In 1995, he was selected as the best player in Partizan's history.\n\n**Question:** Which statement about Bobek's history with Partizan Belgrade is true?\n\n**Options:**\n1. He started playing for Partizan in 1945\n2. He played for Zagreb before Partizan Belgrade\n3. He played for Partizan until 1995\n4. He gained fame after being selected as Partizan's best player\n\n**Analysis:**\nLooking at each option:\n1. The passage clearly states \"He joined them in 1945\" - this is true\n2. The passage doesn't mention him playing for Zagreb as a team, only that he was born there\n3. The passage states he stayed until 1958, not 1995\n4. The passage indicates he gained fame while playing for Partizan, and the 1995 selection was a recognition that came later\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Children develop understanding of nationality and national stereotypes while they are still young, and these national stereotypes affect behavior. For example, children who are associated with minority tribes that are believed to not perform well in school tend to not perform well in school as soon as they learn about the concepts associated with their tribes.\n\n**Question:** According to this passage, a child's knowledge about tribal concepts can affect which of the following?\n\n**Options:**\n1. The minority community they choose to identify with\n2. Their behavior\n3. Their relationship with other children\n4. Their interpretation of tribe\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe passage clearly states that national stereotypes affect behavior (\"kasumba hizo za utaifa huathiri tabia\"). It then provides an example of how children's understanding of tribal concepts affects their academic performance (which is a form of behavior) - children from minority tribes believed to perform poorly in school actually do perform poorly once they learn about these stereotypes associated with their tribes.\n\n2",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** They found that the Sun operates on the same fundamental principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the galaxy was driven by their light, their rotation, and nothing else. A star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow, is determined by using its brightness and rotation together. The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be regarding magnetic reversal.\n\n**Question:** Which of these stimulates the operation of the Sun and other stars?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Brightness and plasma flow\n2. Rossby number, rotation and magnetic reversal\n3. Rotation and brightness\n4. Brightness, Rossby number and rotation\n\n**Answer:**\nAccording to the passage, it clearly states that \"the activity of all stars in the galaxy was driven by their light, their rotation, and nothing else.\" This means the Sun and other stars are operated/driven by their light (brightness) and rotation.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences between them. Virtual team members often work as contact points for their immediate physical groups. They have more freedom compared to traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones which may not be understood by their local management. The presence of a true \"invisible team\" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams. The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.\n\n**Question:** According to the passage, how are regular teams and virtual teams similar?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Both teams are expected to perform at the same level\n2. Both teams work independently to different degrees in day-to-day activities\n3. Both teams report to an invisible management team\n4. Both teams work in the same time zone\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage clearly states in the first sentence that \"Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams\" (वर्चुअल टीमों को भी परंपरागत टीमों की तरह ही उत्कृष्टता के समान मानकों पर रखा जाता है). This directly indicates that both types of teams are expected to perform at the same level of excellence.\n\n1",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** The traditional medieval castle has long inspired imagination, bringing to mind images of jousts, feasts, and Arthurian chivalry. Even standing among thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to conjure the sounds and smells of long-ago battles, almost like hearing the clatter of hooves on cobblestones and smelling the fear rising from dungeon graves. But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and constructed?\n\n**Question:** Which of the following things are NOT mentioned in the passage that could be associated with medieval fortification?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Dungeon pits\n2. Jousts\n3. Chivalry\n4. Knights\n\n**Analysis:**\nLooking at what is mentioned in the passage:\n- Jousts (जत्थों) - mentioned\n- Chivalry (शिष्टता) - mentioned (Arthurian chivalry)\n- Dungeon graves/pits (कालकोठरी के कब्रों) - mentioned\n\nWhat is NOT mentioned:\n- Knights (शूरवीर) - this term does not appear in the passage\n\n4",

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** When hydrogen atoms undergo fusion to create heavier elements, the energy that is released is what allows stars to provide light and heat. Scientists are working to build reactors that can create energy in the same way. This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before we can build useful fusion reactors.\n\n**Question:** According to the passage, what does fusion allow stars to do?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Create heavy elements\n2. Build fusion reactors\n3. Give light and heat\n4. Create hydrogen atoms\n\n**Answer:**\nAccording to the passage, when hydrogen atoms undergo fusion to create heavier elements, the energy released from this process is what allows stars to provide light and heat. Therefore, fusion allows stars to give light and heat.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go directly to the army after completing school education. However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied anthropology, archaeology and later history, and he received a 2:2 (lower second class degree) in it. Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a degree.\n\n**Question:** Based on the given information, what did Charles do first?\n\n**Options:**\n1.

      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further. Scaffolding is not a learning method, but is helpful for people who are learning something new, like running a new computer program or starting a new project. Scaffolds can be virtual as well as real. In other words, teachers are a type of scaffold, but Microsoft Office's paperclip man is also the same. Virtual scaffolds are internal parts of software and they question, indicate, and provide information about processes that would be challenging for students to handle alone.\n\n**Question:** Based on the information given in the passage, which of these is NOT an example of scaffolding?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Tutorial at the beginning of a computer game\n2. SAT tutor\n3. Independent study program\n4. Little league coach\n\n**Analysis:**\nAccording to the passage, scaffolding helps people learn new things by providing support, guidance, and information about processes that would be challenging to handle alone. Let me evaluate each option:\n\n1. Tutorial at the beginning of a computer game - This provides guidance and support for learning new processes (scaffolding)\n2. SAT tutor - This provides support and guidance for learning (scaffolding)\n3. Independent study program - This involves learning alone without external support or guidance (NOT scaffolding)\n4. Little league coach - This provides support and guidance for learning new skills (scaffolding)\n\nThe independent study program is the only option that involves learning without external support or guidance, which contradicts the concept of scaffolding described in the passage.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Sitting in your own car and going on a long journey has its own internal appeal. Unlike large vehicles, you are probably already accustomed to driving your own car and know your limits. Pitching a tent on private property or in a city of any size can easily attract unnecessary attention. Using your car for road trips is a great way, sometimes it also works as a \"camp.\" If you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon in which seats can be folded down, then car camping is possible.\n\n**Question:** According to the given paragraph, what would be helpful for a car stay planner?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Knowing well about the car and its limitations\n2. A vehicle with seats that can be folded down\n3. Tent\n4. Should have private property for camping\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLooking at the passage, it mentions several key points about car camping/staying:\n- You are already accustomed to driving your own car and know your limits\n- The car can work as a \"camp\"\n- If you have a vehicle with seats that can be folded down, car camping is possible\n\nThe passage emphasizes that having a vehicle with foldable seats makes car camping possible, which would be most helpful for someone planning to stay in their car.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Perhaps the most common tourism could be that in which most people are interested in traveling to recreational tourist places. This happens when people go to places completely different from their daily life for rest and entertainment. Beaches, theme parks, and campgrounds are common places where recreation-seeking tourists often visit. If a person's purpose of visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism. Tourists can visit different places in a particular country or they can focus on just one region.\n\n**Question:** What type of tourism does visiting a museum fall under?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Business tourism\n2. Recreational tourism\n3. Cultural tourism\n4. Outdoor tourism\n\n**Answer:**\nBased on the passage, visiting a museum would fall under cultural tourism because the passage states that \"if a person's purpose of visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.\" Museums are places where people go to learn about history, culture, art, and knowledge, which aligns with the definition of cultural tourism provided in the passage.\n\n3",

It has been deployed in the US Navy's seventh fleet and is located in Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan.\n\n**Question:** According to the sentence, which country had thought of taking the captive fighter's feast?\n\n**Options:**\n1. It was on the way to Puerto Princesa\n2. It is located in Palawan\n3. It is a mine countermeasures ship\n4. Assigned to the American Navy's seventh fleet\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe question asks about which country thought of taking a \"captive fighter's feast,\" but this concept is not mentioned anywhere in the passage. The passage only discusses a US Navy mine countermeasure ship that was heading to Puerto Princesa in Palawan and is part of the seventh fleet based in Japan. The question appears to be unrelated to the content of the passage, and none of the options directly answer the question about a country thinking of taking a captive fighter's feast.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option 4 mentions \"American Navy's seventh fleet\" which is the only option that references a country (America/US).\n\n4",

Cabo da Roca\n2. Marian magical presence\n3. Lord Byron's positive review\n4. It is a romantic epic\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAccording to the passage, Sintra was made famous for foreigners after the magnificent exploits recorded by Lord Byron. This directly corresponds to option 3, which mentions Lord Byron's positive review as the reason for Sintra's recognition among foreigners.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the Florida Republican Party presidential primary election on Tuesday with 46 percent of the vote. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich came in second place with 32 percent. As a winner-take-all state, Florida awarded all of its fifty delegates to Romney, advancing him as a strong contender for the Republican Party nomination.\n\n**Question:** Since Florida was a winner-take-all state, what was given to Mitt Romney?\n\n**Options:**\n1. 32 delegates from the state\n2. The Republican Party nomination\n3. Delegates from all states\n4. 46 percent of the vote\n\n**Answer:**\nAccording to the passage, since Florida was a winner-take-all state, it awarded all of its fifty delegates to Romney. While none of the options exactly matches \"fifty delegates,\" option 3 \"delegates from all states\" is incorrect as it refers to delegates from all states rather than all delegates from Florida. Option 1 mentions 32 delegates which is incorrect. Option 2 mentions the nomination itself, but the passage only says this advanced him as a strong contender. Option 4 refers to the vote percentage he received, not what he was given as a result of the winner-take-all system.\n\nLooking more carefully, the passage states that Florida awarded \"all of its fifty delegates\" to Romney. The closest option that captures this concept of receiving delegates (though not perfectly worded) would be option 1, but it incorrectly states 32 delegates instead of 50.\n\nHowever, re-reading the options in Hindi and the passage, option 3 \"सभी राज्यों के प्रतिनिधि\" (delegates from all states) could be misinterpreted, but the passage specifically mentions \"सभी पचास प्रतिनिधियों को\" (all fifty delegates) from Florida specifically.\n\nThe most accurate answer based on what the passage explicitly states Romney received is the delegates, though the numbers in the options don't match perfectly.\n\n3",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** \"Up bow\" symbol looks like a V and \"down bow\" symbol looks like a staple or like a square whose bottom part is missing. Forward means that you should start from the top and push the bow, and backward means that you should start from the frog (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow. An upper-bow usually produces a soft sound, while a lower-bow is strong and more vocal. Feel free to write your own marks, but remember that there are also printed bowing marks for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.\n\n**Question:** According to the passage, which of the following parts of bow pulling is NOT related to what?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Soft sound\n2. The mark would be like a tablet stimulation\n3. Strong voice\n4. Starting from the frog\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage describes:\n- Up bow: produces soft sound\n- Down bow: starts from the frog, produces strong/vocal sound, looks like a staple or square with missing bottom\n\nOption 2 mentions \"tablet stimulation\" which is not mentioned anywhere in the passage. The passage talks about symbols looking like a \"V\" or \"staple\" or \"square with missing bottom,\" but nothing about \"tablet stimulation.\"\n\n2",

Earlier in the day, the winds were about 83 km/h and it was expected to remain weak.\n\n**Question:** According to the passage, when was Tropical Cyclone Gonu expected to weaken?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Before reaching the Maldives\n2. When the wind speed dropped to around 83 kilometers per hour\n3. Before reaching its peak\n4. Before winds reached 149 miles per hour\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage states that earlier in the day, the winds were about 83 km/h and \"it was expected to remain weak\" (इसके कमज़ोर रहने की अपेक्षा थी). This indicates that when the winds were at 83 km/h, the cyclone was expected to stay weak, meaning it was expected to weaken when the wind speeds were around 83 km/h.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** In this season, the initial cases of the disease appeared at the end of July. This disease is caused by pigs, which later spreads to humans through mosquitoes. The outbreak has forced the Indian government to take measures such as deploying pig catchers in severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito nets, and spraying insecticides. The government has promised several million vials of encephalitis vaccine, which will help prepare health agencies for next year. The delivery of vaccines to the historically most affected areas this year has been delayed due to lack of funds and lower priority compared to other diseases.\n\n**Question:** Based on the passage, which preventive measure against the disease will be implemented last?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Insecticides\n2. Pig catchers\n3. Encephalitis vaccines\n4. Mosquito nets\n\n**Answer:**\nAccording to the passage, the government has already deployed pig catchers, distributed mosquito nets, and sprayed insecticides as immediate measures. However, the encephalitis vaccines have been delayed due to lack of funds and lower priority, and the government has promised several million vials that \"will help prepare health agencies for next year,\" indicating these will be implemented last.\n\n3",

Practicing proper nutrition\n2. Consistent performance at elite level\n3. Hydrating effectively\n4. Maintaining a healthy energy balance\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe passage explicitly states that proper nutritional intake alone cannot produce elite performance, but it does mention that proper nutrition, effective hydration, and maintaining healthy energy balance can help athletes improve their performance and increase enjoyment of sports. The passage does NOT recommend \"consistent performance at elite level\" as a way to increase enjoyment - in fact, it suggests that elite performance cannot be achieved through nutrition alone.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** With changes from quarter to half-mile, speed becomes of very little importance and stability becomes an extreme necessity. Certainly a first-class half-mile runner, a person who can take less than two minutes, should have quite a lot of speed, but endurance development is necessary for all dangers. Some cross country running during winters, combined with gym work for upper body strength, is the most appropriate preparation for the running season.\n\n**Question:** According to the given passage, which of the following is extremely important for a first-class half-mile runner?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Running some cross country in winters\n2. Developing endurance instead of speed\n3. Winning in two minutes\n4. Developing speed instead of endurance\n\n**Answer:**\nThe passage clearly states that \"speed becomes of very little importance and stability becomes an extreme necessity\" and \"endurance development is necessary for all dangers.\" While a first-class runner should have speed, the emphasis is on developing endurance rather than focusing solely on speed.\n\n2",
      "**Translation:**\n\n**Passage:** In the savanna, plants available to meet the amino acid requirements of primates with human-like digestive systems might be insufficient. Additionally, failing to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death. The most easily available resources from plants would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest without cooking. In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids. If our own ancestors solved their \"protein problem\" to some extent in the same way, we should not be surprised, as chimpanzees do in today's time.\n\n**Question:** Based on the information given in the paragraph, which of the following should an animal eat to solve the \"protein problem\"?\n\n**Options:**\n1. Dried leaves\n2. Raw legumes\n3. Locusts\n4. Flower stems\n\n**Answer:**\nAccording to the passage, animal food sources like ants, termites, and eggs are easily digestible and provide high amounts of protein with all essential amino acids, unlike plant sources which are difficult to digest without cooking. Among the given options, locusts (option 3) are the only animal food source that would effectively solve the \"protein problem\" as described in the passage.\n\n3",

This city is situated next to the waterfalls, and they are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers plenty of opportunities for both risk-takers and sightseers to stay for extended periods. During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume will be higher and the falls will appear more captivating.

November to March\n2. During tourist season\n3. When water volume is high\n4.
