The problem states \"After 20 years, she is entitled to 5% of the annual pension value per year.\" This likely means that for each year of service, she gets 5% of the full pension, but this calculation starts being relevant after 20 years of service.\n\nLet me reinterpret: For each year worked, she gets 5% of the full pension value, and she needs at least 20 years to be eligible.\n\nStep 4 (corrected): Calculate her pension percentage.\n30 years × 5% per year = 150%\n\nBut this exceeds 100%, which doesn't make sense. Let me reconsider the German text again.\n\nActually, I think the correct interpretation is:\n- After 20 years of service, she becomes eligible for pension benefits\n- For each year of service, she earns 5% of the full pension value\n- The full pension ($50,000",

      "I need to translate and solve this problem about Jackie deciding whether to do her own taxes or hire an accountant.\n\nTranslation: Jackie is trying to decide whether to do her tax return herself or hire an accountant. If she does the tax return herself, she can work 3 hours less as a freelancer and loses $35/hour in lost income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?\n\nNow let me solve this step by step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the opportunity cost if Jackie does her taxes herself.\n- She loses 3 hours of freelance work\n- Her hourly rate is $35/hour\n- Lost income = 3 hours × $35/hour = $105\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cost if she hires an accountant.\n- The accountant charges $90\n\nStep 3: Compare the two options to find how much more money she'll have by hiring the accountant.\n- Cost of doing taxes herself (in lost income): $105\n- Cost of hiring accountant: $90\n- Difference: $105 - $90 = $15\n\nTherefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.\n\n15",
