Watering and nutrition for the tree cost $3 per year. How many years will it take Carlos to start making money with his lemon tree?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nFirst, let me calculate the annual profit from the lemon tree:\n- Annual revenue: 7 lemons × $1.5 = $10.5\n- Annual costs: $3 (watering and nutrition)\n- Annual net profit: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5\n\nNow I need to find when Carlos will break even (recover his initial investment):\n- Initial investment: $90\n- Annual net profit: $7.5\n\nTo break even: $90 ÷ $7.5 = 12 years\n\nAfter 12 years, Carlos will have exactly recovered his initial investment. Starting in year 13, he will begin making money.\n\nHowever, the question asks when he will \"start making money,\" which means when his total profit becomes positive. Since he makes $7.5 profit each year after covering annual costs, he starts making money in the sense of positive cash flow from year 1, but he doesn't recover his initial investment until after 12 years.\n\nThe question is asking when he'll have a net positive return overall, which happens after he's recovered his initial $90 investment.\n\n13",

Sandra had ordered red roses that were 4 times the number of white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which was 5 times the number of white carnations. Sandra threatened to change suppliers if the red roses couldn't be delivered by 5 PM. To keep Sandra as a client, how many red roses does Fred need to prepare by 5 PM?\"\n\nNow let me solve this step by step:\n\nLet x = number of white carnations\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Pink calla lilies = 5 × white carnations = 200\n- So: 5x = 200\n- Therefore: x = 40 white carnations\n\nNow I can find the number of red roses:\n- Red roses = 4 × white carnations\n- Red roses = 4 × 40 = 160\n\n160",
      "**Translation:**\nAnakin and Roxin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. Meanwhile, Roxin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish did they catch?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nFirst, let me find what each person caught:\n\nAnakin caught:\n- 10 starfish\n- 6 seahorses  \n- 3 clownfish\n\nRoxin caught:\n- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish\n- Seahorses: 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses\n- Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish\n\nNow I need to identify which of these are actually fish. Starfish are not fish (they are echinoderms), but seahorses and clownfish are fish.\n\nFish caught by Anakin:\n- 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 9 fish\n\nFish caught by Roxin:\n- 3 seahorses + 5 clownfish = 8 fish\n\nTotal fish caught by both:\n9 + 8 = 17 fish\n\n17",
      "**Translation:**\nA merchant is trying to choose between two purchasing plans: $5,000 worth of jewelry and $8,000 worth of electronics. According to the merchant's financial advisor's estimate, during the same month, the price of jewelry will increase by 2.5% and the price of electronics will increase by 1.2%. If the merchant chooses the purchasing plan that maximizes profit at the end of the month, what will that profit be?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Calculate the profit from the jewelry option.\n- Initial investment: $5,000\n- Price increase: 2.5%\n- Final value: $5,000 × (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 × 1.025 = $5,125\n- Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125\n\nStep 2: Calculate the profit from the electronics option.\n- Initial investment: $8,000\n- Price increase: 1.2%\n- Final value: $8,000 × (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 × 1.012 = $8,096\n- Profit from electronics: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96\n\nStep 3: Compare the profits and choose the maximum.\n- Jewelry profit: $125\n- Electronics profit: $96\n- Maximum profit: $125 (from jewelry)\n\n125",

If there are ten ducks in a flock, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Find how much insects one duck needs per day.\n- One duck needs 3.5 pounds per week\n- Per day: 3.5 ÷ 7 = 0.5 pounds per duck per day\n\nStep 2: Find how much insects ten ducks need per day.\n- Ten ducks need: 10 × 0.5 = 5 pounds per day\n\n5",
      "Let me translate the problem first:\n\n\"Two girls each received 1/6 portion of 24 liters of water. Then a boy received 6 liters of water. How much water will remain?\"\n\nNow let me solve step by step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate how much water each girl received.\nEach girl received 1/6 of 24 liters = 24 × (1/6) = 4 liters\n\nStep 2: Calculate total water received by both girls.\nTotal water for two girls = 4 + 4 = 8 liters\n\nStep 3: Calculate total water distributed.\nWater given to girls = 8 liters\nWater given to boy = 6 liters\nTotal water distributed = 8 + 6 = 14 liters\n\nStep 4: Calculate remaining water.\nInitial water = 24 liters\nWater distributed = 14 liters\nRemaining water = 24 - 14 = 10 liters\n\n10",
      "**Translation:**\nSara wants to buy a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes for herself. The jacket she wants to buy costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's children 4 times, earning $5 each time. Her parents give her $4 each time for mowing the lawn. If Sara already has $10 saved before starting the babysitting work, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to buy the jacket and shoes?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total cost of items Sara wants to buy.\n- Jacket cost: $30\n- 2 pairs of shoes: 2 × $20 = $40\n- Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70\n\nStep 2: Calculate Sara's earnings from babysitting.\n- Babysitting 4 times at $5 each: 4 × $5 = $20\n\nStep 3: Calculate Sara's total money before mowing lawns.\n- Initial savings: $10\n- Babysitting earnings: $20\n- Total before lawn mowing: $10 + $20 = $30\n\nStep 4: Calculate how much more money Sara needs.\n- Money needed: $70 - $30 = $40\n\nStep 5: Calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn.\n- Money earned per lawn mowing: $4\n- Number of times needed: $40 ÷ $4 = 10\n\n10",
      "**Translation:**\nCarlos is planting a lemon tree. It will cost $90 to plant the tree. Each year it will produce 7 lemons, each of which he can sell for $1.5. It costs $3 per year for watering and fertilizing the tree. How many years will it take for him to start earning money from the lemon tree?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nFirst, let me calculate the annual profit from the lemon tree:\n- Annual revenue: 7 lemons × $1.5 = $10.5\n- Annual costs: $3 (watering and fertilizing)\n- Annual profit: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5\n\nNow I need to find when the cumulative profit will exceed the initial investment of $90.\n\nAfter n years:\n- Total profit = $7.5 × n\n- Initial cost = $90\n\nTo start earning money (break even), the total profit must equal or exceed the initial cost:\n$7.5 × n ≥ $90\nn ≥ $90 ÷ $7.5\nn ≥ 12\n\nTherefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to break even and start earning money from the lemon tree.\n\n12",
      "Let me first translate the problem from Bengali to English:\n\n\"Charlie has three times more Facebook friends than Dorothy. James has four times more Facebook friends than Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, how many Facebook friends does James have?\"\n\nNow let me solve this step by step:\n\nStep 1: Find Dorothy's number of Facebook friends.\n- Charlie has 3 times more friends than Dorothy\n- Charlie has 12 friends\n- So: 3 × Dorothy's friends = 12\n- Therefore: Dorothy's friends = 12 ÷ 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: Find James's number of Facebook friends.\n- James has 4 times more friends than Dorothy\n- Dorothy has 4 friends\n- So: James's friends = 4 × 4 = 16\n\n16",
      "Let me first translate the problem from Bengali to English:\n\n\"On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. For each of the next two days, she slept 2 hours less because she had to finish some assignments. If she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week compared to those two days, how many total hours did she sleep for the entire week?\"\n\nNow let me solve this step by step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate Monday's sleep\nMonday: 8 hours\n\nStep 2: Calculate sleep for the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday)\nEach day she slept 2 hours less than Monday\nTuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours\nWednesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours\n\nStep 3: Calculate sleep for the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday)\nShe slept 1 hour more than those two days (Tuesday and Wednesday)\nSo each of the remaining days: 6 + 1 = 7 hours\nThursday: 7 hours\nFriday: 7 hours\nSaturday: 7 hours\nSunday: 7 hours\n\nStep 4: Calculate total sleep for the entire week\nMonday: 8 hours\nTuesday: 6 hours\nWednesday: 6 hours\nThursday: 7 hours\nFriday: 7 hours\nSaturday: 7 hours\nSunday: 7 hours\n\nTotal = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 48 hours\n\n48"
